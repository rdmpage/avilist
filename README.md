# AviList bird checklist

From the [AviList website](https://www.avilist.org/checklist/v2025/).

> The AviList team worked for four years to harmonize the global checklist of birds. The final product includes a consensus taxonomy combined with a full set of taxonomic and nomenclatural components, the details of which are explained at Components of the AviList checklist. Over time, additional information is expected to be added. 

> AviList is free for anyone to use and download in XLSX format. Note that each spreadsheet includes five tabs: AviList v2025; Decision summaries; Recommended citation; How to use; and References.

The Excel spreadsheet is in this repository, and the tabs have been extracted as TSV files for ease of use.
