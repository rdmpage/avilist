Column_header	Description
Sequence	"Linear sequence of taxa in the list, arranged following taxonomic hierarchy (order, family, genus, species, subspecies) and based on a best attempt to ladderize a phylogeny of the birds of the world. For more information, see Linear Sequence under <https://www.avilist.org/checklist/components-of-the-avilist-checklist/#Linear-Sequence>. Note that while the linear sequence of all orders, families, and genera has been updated, the linear sequence at species level is work in progress, with about a quarter updated in v2025. Subspecies are sequenced from Northwest to Southeast."
Taxon_rank	"Taxonomic rank. Ranks included in AviList v2025 are: order, family, genus, species, and subspecies."
Order	Scientific name of the order.
Family	Scientific name of the family.
Family_English_name	English name of the family.
Scientific_name	"Scientific name of the order, family, genus, species, or subspecies."
Authority	"The author and year for the scientific name. If the taxon was not described in the current genus, parentheses are used."
Bibliographic_details	"Bibliographic information for the original description, including the publication, series (ser.)/part (pt)/volume (vol.), number (no.), page (p.), and plate (pl.)/figure (fig.), when relevant."
English_name_AviList	"AviList English name for the species. English names generally match those in use for the IOC World Bird List v15.1, with a small number of modifications to maximize consistency, appropriateness, and breadth of usage. The AviList team acknowledges that different regions may prefer different English names; those published by eBird/Clements <https://www.birds.cornell.edu/clementschecklist/> and BirdLife International <https://datazone.birdlife.org/about-our-science/taxonomy> are also displayed in the extended file. The Cornell Lab maintains alternative English names (at least 15 regionalized versions) for use in eBird and Birds of the World, and these also can be treated as official and valid English names."
English_name_Clements_v2024	"English name for the species used in v2024 of the eBird/Clements Checklist <https://www.birds.cornell.edu/clementschecklist/introduction/updateindex/october-2024/2024-citation-checklist-downloads/>. Note that we do not provide an English name unless the taxonomic concepts are a perfect match (i.e., the same AvibaseID is applied at the rank of species for both AviList v2025 and eBird/Clements v2024)."
English_name_BirdLife_v9	"English name for the species used in v9.1 of the HBW/BirdLife Taxonomic Checklist <https://datazone.birdlife.org/about-our-science/taxonomy>. Note that we do not provide an English name unless the taxonomic concepts are a perfect match (i.e., the same AvibaseID is applied at the rank of species for both AviList v2025 and BirdLife v9.1)."
Proposal_number	Internal proposal number used by the AviList team to track discussion and outcome for each taxonomic or nomenclatural decision.
Decision_summary	"Summary statement to outline the decision reached by the AviList team. TaxCom decisions are numerical, while nomenclatural decisions are preceded by the prefix ""N-"". Cited references are listed in the References tab of the spreadsheet. All Decision Summaries are listed in the tab ""Decision summaries"" and are sequenced taxonomically based on the first taxon that relevant to each Decision Summary. In some cases, multiple Decision Summaries are combined in the same row (i.e., for the same taxon), so each is set off with its proposal number followed by two parentheses, to aid the reader in identifying these cases where multiple issues are combined in one cell. For example: 1031a))  and 1031b))."
Range	"Range statement for all taxa, except polytypic species (these will be added in a later version). These range statements follow the format of the eBird/Clements Checklist and in most cases match those used in eBird/Clements v2024. Within reason, we attempt to standardize on the short names for countries used in ISO 3166-1 and shown here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes>. "
Extinct_or_possibly_extinct	"For certain taxa (family, genus, species, subspecies) we include one of seven possible values: 1) Extinct = taxon is classified as Extinct by BirdLife on the IUCN Red List; 2) (extinct) = taxon is known or believed to be extinct, but has not been formally evaluated by BirdLife for the IUCN Red List (i.e., most subspecies, some taxa not treated as valid species by BirdLife); 3) Possibly Extinct = taxon is classified as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) by BirdLife on the IUCN Red List because it is, “on the balance of evidence, likely to be extinct, but for which there is a small chance that they may be extant”. 4) (possibly extinct) = taxon is believed to be possibly extinct, but has not been formally evaluated by BirdLife for the IUCN Red List (because it is a  subspecies or not treated as valid species by BirdLife); 5) Extinct in the Wild is classified as Extinct in the Wild by BirdLife on the IUCN Red List because it is “known only to survive…in captivity”); 6) Possibly Extinct in the Wild = taxon is classified as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct in the Wild) by BirdLife on the IUCN Red List because it “survives in captivity but is likely to be extinct in the wild”; 7) Previously Extinct in the Wild, but reintroduced = Previously classified by BirdLife as Extinct in Wild, but now extant in the wild because it has been reintroduced and has a self-sustaining population; the two examples in v2025 are both treated as CR (Critically Endangered) by IUCN Red List. The AviList checklist includes taxa that are known to have been extant since 1500 A.D.; extinctions thus relate to those since 1500 A.D. as well. See more about the criteria for inclusion here: <https://www.avilist.org/checklist/components-of-the-avilist-checklist/#Extinct-Species>."
IUCN_Red_List_Category	"IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature; <https://iucn.org/>) Red List status, with criteria and formal definitions at <https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10315>; codes also defined and summarized by BirdLife International at <https://www.birdlife.org/projects/iucn-red-list/>. Red List codes include: EX = Extinct; EW = Extinct in the Wild; CR = Critically Endangered; CR (PE) = Critically Endangered, Possibly Extinct; CR (PEW) = Critically Endangered, Possibly Extinct in the Wild; EN = Endangered; VU = Vulnerable; NT = Near Threatened; LC = Least Concern; DD = Data Deficient. We do not provide Red List status unless the taxonomic concepts are a perfect match (i.e., if the same AvibaseID is not applied for both AviList v2025 and BirdLife v9.1); for species that don't have a perfect match in the BirdLife v9 taxonomy, we use NE = Not evaluated."
BirdLife_DataZone_URL	"Web link to the species page in BirdLife DataZone <datazone.birdlife.org>. As with the English_name_Birdlife_v9 column, we do not provide a DataZone link unless the taxonomic concepts are a perfect match (i.e., if the same AvibaseID is applied for both AviList v2025 and BirdLife v9.1; in this case, a taxon may have the rank of subspecies in AviList and species in DataZone)."
Species_code_Cornell_Lab	"Species code used by the Cornell Lab; these are relevant for construction of URLs in eBird (e.g., <https://ebird.org/map/y00621> or <https://ebird.org/species/y00621>) or Birds of the World (e.g., <https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/species/y00621>). Species codes do not change when English or scientific names change and are usually consistent with the taxonomic concept (i.e., AvibaseID) even through changes in taxonomic rank, but this is not always the case (especially for particularly widespread taxa). As with the English_name_Clements_v2024 column, we do not provide a species code unless the taxonomic concepts are a perfect match (i.e., the same AvibaseID is applied at the rank of species for both AviList v2025 and eBird/Clements v2024)."
Birds_of_the_World_URL	"Web link to the species page in Birds of the World (<birdsoftheworld.org>). As with the English_name_Clements_v2024 column, we do not provide a Birds of the World link unless the taxonomic concepts are a perfect match (i.e., the same AvibaseID is applied at the rank of species for both AviList v2025 and eBird/Clements v2024)."
AvibaseID	"Unique alphanumeric code that is a stable taxonomic identifier relating to the taxonomic concept, independent of nomenclature."
Gender_of_genus	"For genera only; the gender is listed as either masculine (M), feminine (F), or neuter (N)."
Type_species_of_genus	"For genera only; the type species is listed with the scientific name, author, and how the type was designated."
Type_locality	"Information on the type locality, when known."
Title_of_original_description	"Title of the publication (e.g., article) describing the taxon."
Original_description_URL	"Web URL for the original description, when known."
Protonym	Original name in its exact spelling from the publication describing the taxon.
