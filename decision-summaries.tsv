13	30	"Taxa minor and baudinianus are treated as subspecies of Dromaius novaehollandiae based on similarity in mitochondrial DNA (Heupink et al. 2011; Thomson et al. 2018; Cibois et al. 2020). Despite the tremendous size difference of minor, the repeated evolution of small size in isolated island populations over short time periods also argues against species status."	
28	N-70	"Shepherd et al. (2021) show genetically that the syntypes of the Great Spotted Kiwi Apteryx haastii Potts, 1872, are hybrids between the Rowi, A. rowi Tennyson et al., 2003, and Little Spotted Kiwi, A. owenii Gould, 1847. Therefore, Potts' name haastii does not apply to the species known as the Great Spotted Kiwi. The earliest name that does apply to the Great Spotted Kiwi is Apteryx maxima Sclater & von Hochstetter, 1861, an earlier name than haastii which Palma et al. (2003) had designated a nomen oblitum under Art. 23.9 of the Code. The grounds for that designation under that article no longer exist; and as nomina oblita remain available names under the Code's Glossary and there is no other younger name in wide use, Shepherd et al. (2021) returned to maxima Sclater & Hochstetter, 1861 as the name for the Great Spotted. Hence, the correct name for the Great Spotted Kiwi is Apteryx maxima."	
37	56	"Taxon tarapacensis (polytypic, including garleppi) is treated as conspecific with Rhea pennata based on available evidence. Although reported to differ in breeding plumage and tarsal scutellation, a comprehensive review of phenotypic variation and potential intergradation at the contact zone is required; genetic data would also be informative."	
78	103	"Taxon chacoensis (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Nothura maculosa (polytypic) based on similarities in plumage, morphometrics, and vocalizations (Hayes et al. 2018), and genetics (Almeida et al. 2022)."	
211	106	"Taxon occidentalis (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Crypturellus cinnamomeus (polytypic) based on available evidence. A more comprehensive review of plumage, morphometrics, and vocalizations is required; genetic data would also be informative."	
280	52	"Taxa ferruginea and andina are treated as subspecies of Oxyura jamaicensis based on available evidence. Although ferruginea and nominate jamaicensis are phenotypically distinct, low mitochondrial DNA divergence (McCracken & Sorenson 2005) and shared haplotypes occur (Lozano-Jaramillo et al. 2018). Furthermore, the geographically intermediate taxon, andina, is of hybrid origin (Adams & Slavid 1984; Fjeldså 1986; McCracken & Sorenson 2005, Muñoz-Fuentes et al. 2013; Donegan et al. 2015; Lozano-Jaramillo et al. 2018), suggesting that all three are best treated as conspecific pending further research."	
336	N-45	"Anser cygnoid has also been used. The spelling cygnoides is in prevailing usage and thus protected by Article 33.3.1. Even if the argument of prevailing usage were to be discounted, a majority of the community considered it preferable to spell out this intended abbreviation to comply with widespread practice among zoologists in many other animal groups to spell out obvious cases of abbreviations."	
344	8	"Taxon serrirostris (polytypic, including rossicus) is treated as a species separate from Anser fabalis (polytypic, including johanseni and middendorffii) based on available evidence. The species are morphologically diagnosable (de Jong 2019) and ecologically separated to a large extent (Sangster & Oreel 1996). Genetic data are complicated by a history of introgressive hybridization (Ottenburghs et al. 2020, 2023), rapid speciation (Ottenburghs et al. 2016), and incongruent phylogenetic reconstructions (Ruokenen et al. 2008; Ottenburghs et al. 2016, 2020, 2023). However, genomic data consistently show A. brachyrhynchus to be nested within the fabalis-serrirostris complex (Ottenburghs et al. 2016, 2023) with highly differentiated genomic regions providing strong support for a 3-species treatment (Ottenburghs et al. 2023): A. fabalis, A. brachyrhynchus, and A. serrirostris. For taxonomic stability, middendorffii is treated as a subspecies of A. fabalis, but a more comprehensive genomic review is needed to determine if species status is warranted (Ruokenen et al. 2008)."	
367	53	"Taxa jubata and melanoptera are placed in Neochen and Chloephaga, respectively, pending further research. Sometimes placed together in Oressochen based on similarities in plumage, structure, and behavior, a relationship also suggested by limited mitochondrial DNA data (Bulgarella et al. 2014). However, morphological differences between them are pronounced, and a supermatrix analysis did not recover them as sister lineages (Eo et al. 2009), indicating the need for further research. The proposed arrangement is adopted to support taxonomic stability."	
444	79	Taxon hymenolaimus is recognized as a subspecies of Hymenolaimus malacorhynchos based on differences in mitochondrial DNA (Robertson et al. 2007a) and plumage (Marchant & Higgins 1990).	
467	81	"Taxon extima is treated as a synonym of Aythya australis, as the evidentiary basis for recognition as a subspecies is weak."	
491	6	"The Falkland Islands are retained in the range circumscription of Tachyeres patachonicus based on morphological and genetic evidence that it occurs there. Although Fulton et al. (2012), using mitochondrial DNA, suggested that flighted birds on the Falkland Islands were T. brachypterus, with flight ability a polymorphic trait, genomic data (Campagna et al. 2019) confirmed the presence of both species with the patachonicus genomes showing evidence of introgression from brachypterus; further research would be informative."	
516	74	Taxon variegata is recognized as a subspecies of Spatula rhynchotis based on variation in male breeding plumage.	
544	80	"Taxon diazi is recognized as a monotypic species (Anas diazi) based mostly on nuclear and genomic DNA evidence (Lavretsky et al. 2019). Sometimes treated as a subspecies in the A. platyrhynchos complex, or as a subspecies of A. fulvigula as suggested by mitochondrial DNA data (e.g., Robertson & Goldstien 2012), diazi is genetically differentiated from both species."	
566	7	"Taxon carolinensis is treated as a subspecies of Anas crecca based on high levels of introgression, coupled with a lack of known differences in courtship vocalization. Although mitochondrial DNA data show a relatively deep divergence between these taxa (Peters et al. 2012), a lack of genomic divergence (McLaughlin et al. 2020; Spaulding et al. 2023) indicates that male-mediated gene flow is extensive."	
575	82	"Taxon gracilis is treated as a species separate from Anas gibberifrons based on available evidence. Differentiation in underwing pattern, subtle differences in overall coloration, and presence/absence of male forehead bulge, suggest that it is best to maintain species status pending further research, including assessment of the magnitude and patterns of intermediacy in these traits."	
579	96	Taxon alexanderi is recognized as a subspecies of Anas castanea based on differences in plumage and divergence in mitochondrial DNA haplotype frequencies (Joseph et al. 2009).	
582	83	Taxon remissa is treated as a subspecies of Anas gracilis based on plumage and size.	
585	97	"Taxa chlorotis and nesiotis are treated as monotypic species separate from Anas aucklandica based on available evidence. Sometimes considered subspecies of A. aucklandica, differences in morphology and behavior (Livezey 1990; Marchant & Higgins 1990), and mitochondrial DNA divergence (Kennedy & Spencer 2000; Robertson & Goldstien 2012; Rosinger et al. 2024) suggest they are better maintained as species pending further research."	
629	109	"Taxon forsteni (polytypic, including buruensis) is treated as conspecific with Megapodius freycinet (polytypic) based on available evidence. Although the M. freycinet sensu lato complex is phenotypically variable, differences are mostly in size, and in shading of plumage and bare parts (Eaton et al. 2021); genetic divergences based on mitochondrial (Birks & Edwards 2002) and multilocus DNA data (Harris et al. 2014b) are also small. Further research will be needed to determine species limits in this complex."	
660	110	"Taxon grayi is treated as a monotypic species separate from Pipile cumanensis based on differences in plumage and wattle color, supported by evidence of low levels of introgression in a contact zone (Olmos 1998). However, mitochondrial DNA divergence is shallow (Frank-Hoeflich et al. 2007) and further research is warranted."	
716	112	"Taxon pinima (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Crax fasciolata (polytypic) based on available evidence. Sometimes treated as a distinct species based on differences in female plumage, phenotypic assessments are based on a small number of specimens, and genetic data are lacking. Further research may support species recognition of pinima and grayi."	
753	706	"Taxon remota is treated as a subspecies of Ortalis guttata based on available evidence. Sometimes treated as a subspecies of O. squamata, although Silveira et al. (2017) further proposed remota be recognised as a full species on the basis of differences in plumage and bare part color. As plumage traits appear to align remota more closely to O. guttata, it is placed there pending further research including genetic data."	
759	111	Taxon ruficeps is treated as a monotypic species separate from Ortalis motmot based on consistent differences in morphology and vocalizations (Tomotani et al. 2020).	
783	113	"Taxa edouardi (polytypic, including barbata) and verreauxi (polytypic) are treated as species separate from Guttera pucherani (monotypic) based on differences in plumage, eye color, and bare parts color. However, further research is needed including investigation of potential hybrid zones and formal bioacoustic analysis. Genetic data would also be informative."	
851	114	"Taxon leucopogon (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Colinus cristatus (polytypic) based on plumage, most notably the size of the crest and facial color. Nevertheless, extensive variation occurs within each group and levels of intergradation within, and possibly between them, requires further study. Genetic and vocal data would also be informative."	
896	115	"Taxon sallei is treated as a subspecies of Cyrtonyx montezumae to maintain taxonomic stability pending further research. Sometimes split based on plumage differences but vocalizations are similar (Eitniear et al. 2020); furthermore, genomic data (Salter et al. 2022) suggest that subspecies sallei and rowleyi may be closer to C. ocellatus."	
951	117	"Taxon obscuratus (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Xenoperdix udzungwensis based on available evidence. Plumage differences, although numerous, appear more consistent with subspecific differentiation, and mitochondrial DNA divergence is weak (Bowie & Fjeldså 2005). Further research including bioacoustic analyses would be informative."	
985	118	"Taxon diversa (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Arborophila cambodiana (polytypic) based on available evidence. Variation appears to be clinal, with chandamonyi being geographically and phenotypically intermediate between the terminal taxa."	
1079	133	"Taxa bonasia (polytypic) and sewerzowi (polytypic) are placed in Tetrastes based on genetics. Sometimes placed in Bonasa, multilocus DNA data do not recover the genus as monophyletic (Cai et al. 2018; Kimball et al. 2021)."	
1154	431	"Taxon scotica (monotypic, with hibernica as a synonym) is treated as a species separate from Lagopus lagopus based on differences in plumage, moult patterns, and genome-wide DNA data (Quintela et al. 2010; Kozma et al. 2019; Sangster et al. 2022b). The genetic study of Kozma et al. (2019) suggests that plumage similarities between taxon L. scotica and L. l. variegata are likely convergent, and that the placement of scotica within L. lagopus sensu lato based on mitochondrial DNA data (Gutiérrez et al. 2002) is likely due to mitochondrial DNA artifacts. A detailed comparison of vocalizations to support this split is lacking and clarification on the status of hibernica is needed."	
1173	129	"Taxon canadensis is placed in the genus Canachites based on genetic evidence that Falcipennis is paraphyletic (Kimball et al. 2011, 2021; Persons et al. 2016)."	
1174	130	"Taxon franklinii (polytypic, including isleibi) is treated as conspecific with Canachites canadensis based on available evidence. Plumage differences between franklinii and canadensis are broadly clinal, previously described differences in clapping display show intermediacy, and there is a broad zone of intergradation in plumage traits between them, with subspecies isleibi phenotypically intermediate. Limited mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data (Barry & Tallmon 2010) indicate limited divergence and evidence of gene flow within the complex."	
1194	131	"Genus Lyrurus is recognized for tetrix and mlokosiewiczi, based on plumage and monophyly."	
1237	125	"Taxon versicolor (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Phasianus colchicus (polytypic) based on reproductive behavior and genetics. Although the two species hybridize, post-zygotic selection against hybrids (Brazil 1991) or genetic swamping (McCarthy 2006) appears to operate. Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA also show levels of divergence similar to other species pairs of pheasants (Liu et al. 2020b)."	
1314	127	Taxon pyronota is treated as a monotypic species separate from Lophura erythrophthalma (monotypic) based on obvious plumage differences; genetic and more definitive behavioral evidence is desired.	
1320	128	Taxon rufa is treated as a monotypic species separate from Lophura ignita (polytypic) based on obvious plumage differences; genetic and behavioral evidence needed.	
1339	126	"The genus Tropicoperdix is recognized for chloropus, charltonii, and graydoni following Chen et al. (2015). Sometimes placed in Arborophila, multilocus DNA data support their placement in a separate genus, thus highlighting an extraordinary case of parallelism."	
1340	119	Taxon graydoni (monotypic) is treated as a species separate from Tropicoperdix charltonii (polytypic) based on its distinctive facial pattern and bare parts color (Eaton et al. 2021). Taxon tonkinensis (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Arborophila chloropus (polytypic) based on available evidence; further research needed.	
1388	132	"The genera Peliperdix, Ortygornis, Francolinus, and Campocolinus are here recognized based on a combination of genetic, vocal, and morphological data (Cai et al. 2017; Mandiwana-Neudani et al. 2019; Crowe et al. 2020; Kimball et al. 2021). As the position of monospecific Peliperdix is poorly resolved, future revisions may be needed."	
1410	122	"Taxon elgonensis is treated as a monotypic species separate from Scleroptila psilolaema (monotypic) based on plumage, vocalizations, and genetics (Hunter et al. 2019; Turner et al. 2020)."	
1420	123	Taxon whytei is split from Scleroptila shelleyi based on plumage and genetics. Mitochondrial DNA data (Mandiwana-Neudani et al. 2019) indicate species-level divergence between these taxa but intra-generic relationships remain poorly resolved (Mandiwana-Neudani et al. 2019; Kimball et al. 2021).	
1480	121	"Genus Synoicus is recognized for chinensis, adansonii, ypsilophorus, and monorthonyx, based on genetics (Hosner et al. 2017; Kimball et al. 2021). Sometimes split as multiple genera, but these taxa form a strongly supported clade based on genomic data (Hosner et al. 2017)."	
1575	134	Taxon atrifrons is treated as conspecific with Pternistis castaneicollis based on available evidence. Divergence in mitochondrial DNA and phenotypic traits (Töpfer et al. 2014) is more consistent with subspecies status in francolins (Bloomer & Crowe 1998).	
1636	14	Taxon tricolor (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Tachybaptus ruficollis (polytypic) based on available evidence. A thorough review of genetic and phenotypic variation within T. ruficollis sensu lato is needed to determine species limits within this complex.	
1689	238	"Taxon juninensis (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Podiceps occipitalis based on available evidence. Mitochondrial DNA divergences are shallow (Ogawa et al. 2015) and did not recover P. occipitalis sensu lato as monophyletic. Despite apparent differences in breeding plumage, vocalizations, and behavior, a more detailed analysis of genetic and geographic variation in the juninensis-occipitalis-taczanowskii complex is needed."	
1711	687	"Taxon leopoldi (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Crinifer personatus, as plumage differences are modest and variable within each taxon, and no behavioral or ecological differences have been identified; genetic data would be informative."	
1714	686	Corythaixoides and Criniferoides are placed in the genus Crinifer based on a combination of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA data (Veron & Winney 2000; Njabo & Sorenson 2009; Perkta_ et al. 2020).	
1717	688	"Revised generic limits in Tauraco are based on the mitochondrial-DNA dominated data of Perkta_ et al. (2020) and include recognition of a polytypic Gallirex (species porphyreolophus and johnstoni, the latter sometimes placed in Ruwenzorornis), a polytypic Menelikornis (species leucotis and ruspolii), and a broad Tauraco (remaining species). While Musophaga is sometimes used for rossae and violaceus, those are subsumed within Tauraco as Perkta_ et al. (2020) showed that, while phenotypically distinct from green-bodied turacos, they form a well-supported clade that also includes T. macrorhynchus."	
1727	689	"Taxon donaldsoni (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Menelikornis leucotis based on available evidence. Although donaldsoni can be diagnosed based on plumage (crown color) it is unclear if this trait is genetically determined or influenced by dietary and/or environmental factors. Furthermore, the level of mitochondrial DNA divergence from leucotis is low, and additional research, especially in areas of apparent sympatry (Gedeon et al. 2022), is needed to determine levels of gene flow."	
1791	685	Eupodotis is split into four polytypic genera based on the mitochondrial DNA data of Pitra et al. (2002) and Broders et al. (2003): Lophotis; Eupodotis; Heterotetrax; and Afrotis.	
1851	1027	"Taxon squamiger is treated as a monotypic species separate from Neomorphus geoffroyi (polytypic) based on consistent differences in plumage without evidence of intermediacy (Firme et al. 2014), supported by limited mitochondrial DNA data (Sorenson et al. 2003; Sorenson & Payne 2005)."	
1869	1030	"Taxon pyropyga is treated as a subspecies of Coua cristata as the evidentiary basis for a split is weak. Plumage differences are few, obvious vocal differences are lacking, and reports of intergradation (e.g., Goodman 2013) are inconsistent; further research needed."	
1876	1029	"Taxon olivaceiceps is treated as a monotypic species separate from Coua ruficeps based on plumage and vocalizations (Dowsett-Lemaire 2004). Although reports of a broad zone of intergradation have not been substantiated, further research, including genetic analyses and playback experiments, would be informative."	
1917	1020	"Taxon burchellii (polytypic, including fasciipygialis) is treated as a species separate from Centropus superciliosus based on plumage differences, supported by limited hybridization in areas of contact (Harrison et al. 1997). However, ecological and vocal differences have not been documented, suggesting further research is warranted."	
1952	"1031a, 1031b"	"1031a)) Taxon spilopterus is treated as a subspecies of Centropus phasianinus based on available evidence. Despite obvious differences in plumage, vocalizations are similar, and mitochondrial DNA divergence is shallow (Sorenson & Payne 2005). Furthermore, the extent of melanization varies within C. phasianinus, with the plumage of spilopterus being at the dark extreme; further research needed. 1031b)) Taxon mui is treated as a subspecies of Centropus phasianinus based on the lack of known vocal differentiation and possibility that the strong plumage differences (Eaton et al. 2016) are based on a simple shift in melanization."	
1953	1031b	Taxon mui is treated as a subspecies of Centropus phasianinus based on the lack of known vocal differentiation and possibility that the strong plumage differences (Eaton et al. 2016) are based on a simple shift in melanization.	
1954	1031a	"Taxon spilopterus is treated as a subspecies of Centropus phasianinus based on available evidence. Despite obvious differences in plumage, vocalizations are similar, and mitochondrial DNA divergence is shallow (Sorenson & Payne 2005). Furthermore, the extent of melanization varies within C. phasianinus, with the plumage of spilopterus being at the dark extreme; further research needed."	
1977	1028	Taxon oeneicaudus is treated as a monotypic species separate from Phaenicophaeus curvirostris based on plumage differences (Eaton et al. 2016) commensurate with species status in other members of this complex.	
1999	1032	"Taxon cumingi is placed in the genus Dasylophus based on genetics. Phenotypically and vocally very distinct and sometimes placed in the monospecific genus Lepidogrammus, mitochondrial DNA data (Sorenson & Payne 2005) instead support a sister relationship with D. superciliosus and a divergence consistent with congeneric taxa in related cuckoos."	
2018	1033	"Taxon mexicana is treated as a monotypic species separate from Piaya cayana based on differences in plumage, tail length, mitochondrial DNA divergence (Sánchez-González et al. 2023), and vocal differences (Dyer & Howell 2023). Additional splits within the South American populations are likely based on plumage, soft-part colors, and genomic divergence (Smith et al. 2014); however, further research incorporating denser taxonomic and genomic sampling is needed."	
2046	1034	"Taxon bahamensis is treated as a subspecies of Coccyzus merlini, as the evidentiary basis for a split is weak. More information on vocal and genetic variation across this complex is needed, along with a formal analysis of phenotypic variation."	
2071	1039	"Taxon melanorhynchus (polytypic, including facialis) is treated as a species separate from Eudynamys orientalis based on vocalizations (Eaton et al. 2021), supported by plumage differences and limited mitochondrial DNA data (Sorenson & Payne 2005). Additionally, taxon corvinus is treated as a subspecies of E. scolopaceus, and the status of the New Guinea taxon rufiventer requires resolution as it has been considered sympatric with E. orientalis (Rand 1941); further research needed."	
2101	1035	"Australasian Chalcites (polytypic) is recognized as a genus separate from Afro-Asian Chrysococcyx (polytypic) based on a combination of morphology, osteology (Hughes 2000), and zoogeography, supported by mitochondrial DNA data (Sorenson & Payne 2005). Corroborating data from nuclear or genomic DNA are needed."	
2112	"1038a, 1038b"	"1038a)) Taxon crassirostris is treated as a monotypic species separate from Chalcites minutillus based on its distinctive plumage and vocalizations (Eaton et al. 2021). However, as crassirostris is only weakly diverged from minutillus based on mitochondrial DNA data (Sorenson & Payne 2005) information from nuclear or genomic DNA data will be needed to affirm this split. 1038b)) Taxa salvadorii and rufomerus, traditionally aligned with the 'pied group' of bronze-cuckoo, are treated as subspecies of Chalcites minutillus based on plumage (Eaton et al. 2016) and voice."	
2117	1038b	"Taxa salvadorii and rufomerus, traditionally aligned with the 'pied group' of bronze-cuckoo, are treated as subspecies of C. minutillus based on plumage (Eaton et al. 2016) and voice."	
2124	1038a	"Taxon crassirostris is treated as a monotypic species separate from Chalcites minutillus based on its distinctive plumage and vocalizations (Eaton et al. 2021). However, as crassirostris is only weakly diverged from minutillus based on mitochondrial DNA data (Sorenson & Payne 2005) information from nuclear or genomic DNA data will be needed to affirm this split."	
2125	1037	"Three genera are recognized in Cacomantis based on plumage and behavior, supported in part by mitochondrial DNA data (Sorenson & Payne 2005): monotypic Heteroscenes (spp. pallidus); monotypic Caliechthrus (spp. leucolophus); and polytypic Cacomantis. As phylogenetic relationships remain poorly resolved, further research will be needed to corroborate these generic allotments."	
2149	1036	The Cacomantis sepulcralis-variolosus-aeruginosus complex is treated as six species based mostly on a combined analysis of vocalizations and phenotype (Wu et al. 2022a): polytypic C. sepulcralis; monotypic C. virescens; polytypic C. aeruginosus; polytypic C. variolosus; monotypic C. blandus; and monotypic C. addendus. A comprehensive genetic review of this complex is needed.	
2168	1021	"Taxon lemaireae is recognized as a cryptic subspecies of Cercococcyx mechowi based on vocalizations (Boesman & Collar 2019) although plumage differences are lacking. Further research needed as morphometric and genetic data may prove informative, and investigation of a potential hybrid zone between these taxa should be considered."	
2381	398	"Taxon battyi (polytypic, including malae) is treated as conspecific with Leptotila plumbeiceps pending further research. The vocalizations of battyi are distinct from plumbeiceps but appear similar to other species in the genus (L. rufaxilla and L. pallida) making the placement of battyi uncertain. A comprehensive analysis of genetics, vocalizations, and plumages is needed."	
2470	426	"Taxon doreya (polytypic) is split from Macropygia amboinensis based on the vocal analysis of Ng et al. (2016). However, genetic and morphological analyses will be needed to better define species limits in the doreya-amboinensis complex."	
2491	428	"Although sometimes treated as a subspecies within Macropygia emiliana, taxon borneensis is treated as a subspecies of Macropygia tenuirostris based on the vocal analysis of Ng et al. (2016)."	
2496	"427, 428"	"427)) Macropygia emiliana is split into three species based on the vocal analysis of Ng et al. (2016): emiliana (polytypic); modiglianii (polytypic); and cinnamomea (monotypic). 428)) Although sometimes treated as a subspecies within Macropygia emiliana, taxon borneensis is treated as a subspecies of Macropygia tenuirostris based on the vocal analysis of Ng et al. (2016)."	
2499	427	Macropygia emiliana is split into three species based on the vocal analysis of Ng et al. (2016): emiliana (polytypic); modiglianii (polytypic); and cinnamomea (monotypic).	
2534	403	"Taxon albipennis is treated as a subspecies of Patagioenas maculosa as the evidentiary basis for a split is weak. While some plumage differences occur, information on vocalizations is lacking and the taxa appear to be elevational replacements. Further research, especially in areas where their ranges might meet, is required."	
2544	399	"Taxon albilinea (polytypic, including roraimae and crissalis) is treated as conspecific with Patagioenas fasciata based on available evidence. Although southern albilinea and northern fasciata differ consistently in morphology and vocalizations, the geographically intermediate taxon crissalis is apparently intermediate in both morphology (including bill pattern) and vocalizations (e.g., Hellmayr & Conover 1942). Further research integrating genetics, morphology, and vocalizations, is needed to better define species limits in this group."	
2573	402	Spilopelia is adopted for chinensis and senegalensis based on genetic evidence. Combined analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences in Streptopelia sensu lato (Johnson et al. 2001; Fulton et al. 2012) recovered Spilopelia as part of a basal polytomy with Nesoenas and a reduced Streptopelia. Retaining a monophyletic Streptopelia sensu lato is valid but would result in a phenotypically diverse genus.	
2574	401	"Taxon suratensis (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Spilopelia chinensis (polytypic) based on available evidence. Although western suratensis differs from eastern chinensis in voice and morphology, the geographically intermediate taxon tigrina is intermediate in appearance and vocalizations. A more detailed analysis of all forms, including genetics, is needed."	
2587	425	"Taxon picturatus (polytypic) is placed in the genus Nesoenas based on genetics and vocalizations. Formerly placed in Streptopelia, mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Johnson et al. 2001) show that picturatus is sister to Nesoenas mayeri, and the two share striking vocal similarities (Johnson et al. 2001; Wolfenden et al. 2015)."	
2593	65	"Extinct taxon duboisi is treated as a subspecies of Nesoenas mayeri based on available evidence. Known only from a single subfossil humerus, mensural analysis (Mourer-Chauviré et al. 1999) shows it to fall within the range of mayeri for all traits except length, which is only slightly longer."	
2597	405	"Taxon larvata (polytypic) is placed in the genus Aplopelia based on ecology, behavior, and genetics. Previously placed in Columba, but genomic and mitochondrial DNA data suggest that larvata may be aligned with Streptopelia and related genera (Boyd et al. 2022) or form part of a basal polytomy with these groups (Pereira 2013). In addition, A. larvata is a ground-feeding granivore, unlike the predominantly frugivorous forest-dwelling Columba."	
2641	400	"Taxon xanthocycla is treated as a monotypic species separate from Streptopelia decaocto based on clear differences in size, vocalizations, and bare parts color, with S. xanthocycla distinguished by the presence of a prominent yellow eye-ring, and genetic data from mitochondrial and genomic DNA (van Grouw et al. 2024)."	
2812	406	"Taxon delalandii (polytypic, including granti) is treated as conspecific with Treron calvus (polytypic) based on the absence of vocal and behavioral differences between them. Complex patterns of plumage variation also occur within T. calvus sensu lato with evidence of intergradation and clinality. Genetic data are lacking and further research would be required before making any splits in this group."	
2840	409	"Taxon permagnus (polytypic, including medioximus) is treated as conspecific with Treron formosae based on available evidence. While there are differences in size and plumage, the taxa appear vocally similar; further evidence, including genetic data, needed."	
2846	410	"Taxon brevirostris (polytypic, including occipitalis) and taxon nigrorum (monotypic) are treated as conspecific with Phapitreron leucotis based on available evidence. Vocalizations within this group are complex and all three taxa are phenotypically distinct; formal bioacoustic and genetic studies are needed before making any splits."	
2851	411	"The monotypic taxa maculipectus and frontalis are treated as conspecific with Phapitreron amethystinus based on available evidence. There is likely to be more than one species in this complex, but vocal and genetic data that would allow identification of the optimal arrangement are currently lacking."	
2883	408	The genus name Pampusana is used for Alopecoenas following Bruce et al. (2016).	
2889	407	"Taxon johannae (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Pampusana beccarii (monotypic) based on available plumage, vocal, and genetic evidence. Although the two forms differ in plumage and habitat, the bold white eye-ring of nominate johannae is lacking in some populations. Moyle et al. (2013) using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data showed a consistent pattern of differentiation between solomonensis and beccarii but did not include johannae in the analysis; P. canifrons was also found to be embedded within P. beccarii sensu lato, indicating the need for further research. More extensive genetic and bioacoustic data are required before making any splits."	
2954	404	"The taxa aruensis, cervicalis, and insularis are treated as subspecies of Otidiphaps nobilis following Beehler & Pratt (2016), despite differences in plumages. Detailed analysis of vocalizations and broader genetic sampling are needed to affirm any splits."	
3002	412	"Taxon oenothorax is treated as a monotypic species separate from Ducula aenea (polytypic) based on plumage differences. Further research, including genetics and vocalizations, is needed to determine species limits within D. aenea, as the distinctive taxon paulina may also warrant species status."	
3033	413	"Taxon geelvinkiana is treated as a monotypic species separate from Ducula myristicivora (monotypic) based on morphological (size, bill knob, eye color, and plumage) and vocal differences, following Beehler & Pratt (2016)."	
3038	414	Taxon obiensis (monotypic) is treated as conspecific with Ducula basilica based on available evidence. Plumage differences seem more consistent with subspecific differentiation; further evidence from genetics and vocalizations needed before making this split.	
3057	415	"Taxon salvadorii (monotypic) is treated as conspecific with Ducula pinon (polytypic) based on available evidence. Morphological differences among the three forms—nominate pinon, jobiensis and salvadorii—are of the same order, pinon and jobiensis intergrade broadly where they meet, and there is no evidence of vocal differentiation within the complex."	
3064	416	Taxon cuprea is treated as a monotypic species separate from Ducula badia (polytypic) based on eye color and small but consistent differences in vocalizations (Niranjana & Praveen 2021).	
3078	422	Four genera are recognized within the broad Ptilinopus group: Megaloprepia; Ramphiculus; Alectroenas; and Ptilinopus (including Chrysoena and Drepanoptila). This conservative arrangement is most consistent with the combined nuclear and mitochondrial DNA data in Cibois et al. (2014).	
3096	418	Taxon meridionalis (monotypic) is treated as conspecific with Ramphiculus fischeri (polytypic) based on evidence of clinality in plumage traits and intermediacy of the form centralis.	
3131	421	"Taxon gestroi (monotypic) is treated as conspecific with Ptilinopus ornatus based on available evidence. Plumages differ in color but not in pattern, suggesting subspecific differentiation within the ornatus group of species. More evidence, including genetics, is needed to support the split."	
3137	423	"Taxon temminckii (monotypic) is treated as conspecific with Ptilinopus superbus based on available evidence. Plumages differ in color, rather than pattern, and are constant across large geographic areas. Vocal and genetic evidence is needed to support this split."	
3145	424	Taxon fasciatus (monotypic) is treated as conspecific with Ptilinopus porphyraceus based on available evidence. Differences in plumage and size are modest and could be considered subspecific-level differentiation. No vocal differences are apparent and status of intermediate form graeffei needs to be clarified.	
3162	419	"Taxon chrysogaster is treated as a monotypic species separate from Ptilinopus purpuratus (polytypic) based on genetic evidence. An analysis dominated by mitochondrial DNA data (Cibois et al. 2014) placed chrysogaster as a sister taxon to P. rarotongensis with strong support, suggesting chrysogaster may not be part of the purpuratus group. However, genetic divergences between all three species are relatively shallow; further clarification from genomic DNA may be needed to better resolve species limits in this group."	
3185	999	"Taxon bellus is treated as a subspecies of Ptilinopus rivoli based on available evidence. Sometimes treated as a separate species based on plumage, ecology, and vocalizations, records of ecogeographic replacement are imprecise and vocalizations overlap, supporting treatment as a subspecies."	
3191	420	"Taxon speciosus is treated as a monotypic species separate from Ptilinopus solomonensis (polytypic) based on differences in plumage, presence of a yellow peri-orbital skin patch, and vocalizations. Additionally, speciosus is a highly disjunct population from an endemism-rich area (Gregory 2017). Broader genetic sampling of the P. solomonensis-P. rivoli complex is needed to better define species limits in this group."	
3240	542	"Taxon ochroptera is retained as a subspecies of Psophia crepitans based largely on genetic evidence. Mitochondrial DNA divergences are relatively shallow and the three subspecies in this complex form an unresolved polytomy (Ribas et al. 2012). More detailed analysis of plumage variation, vocalizations, and genomic data are needed to support a split."	
3245	543	"Psophia viridis is treated as a single species based largely on genetic evidence. Oppenheimer & Silveira (2009) advocated the split of P. viridis into three monotypic species based on consistent plumage differences but mitochondrial DNA divergences are relatively shallow (Ribas et al. 2012), and no vocal differences have been reported."	
3280	50	"Anthropoides (polytypic) and Bugeranus (monotypic) are placed in the genus Grus based on available evidence. Analysis of complete mitochondrial genomes (Krajewski et al. 2010), and multilocus DNA data (Fain et al. 2007) failed to resolve basal relationships among these genera, indicating that they are best retained in an expanded Grus pending further research."	
3358	1147	Generic limits in the Rallidae are modified based on mitochondrial (Brown et al. 2022) and genomic DNA (Kirchman et al. 2021) evidence: taxa cerverai; colombianus; and erythrops are placed in Mustelirallus; taxon schomburgkii is placed in Rufirallus.	
3421	1128	"Taxon aequatorialis (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Rallus limicola based on vocalizations. However, further research, including genetics and a formal bioacoustic analysis, would be informative."	
3440	1132	Taxon egregia is placed in the monotypic genus Crecopsis based on nuclear and genomic DNA evidence of non-monophyly with Crex crex (Garcia-R et al. 2020; Kirchman et al. 2021).	
3454	1159	"An interim decision on species limits in Laterallus is based mostly on the multilocus, nuclear, and genomic data of Stervander et al. (2019), Garcia-R et al. (2020), Kirchman et al. (2021) and Depino et al. (2023), supported in part by vocal, morphological and ecological evidence. Accordingly, a polytypic Rufirallus is recognized, with fasciatus, leucopyrrhus, and xenopterus placed there, along with viridis and schomburgkii, as these form a monophyletic clade (Depino et al. 2023) sister to the remaining genera; taxon castaneiceps has been placed in Rufirallus, but placement in a monotypic Anurolimnas is well supported by recent studies (Kirchman et al. 2021; Depino et al. 2023); although genetic data are lacking, taxon podarces is placed in the monotypic genus Aphanocrex based on its distinctive morphology; taxon notatus is placed in Laterallus rather than Coturnicops based on Depino et al. (2023); all remaining species (melanophaius, levraudi, albigularis, ruber, exilis, rogersi, spiloptera, spilonota, jamaicensis and flaviventer) are placed in Laterallus. Further revisions are likely subject to publication of ongoing integrative research."	
3479	1131	"A broad genus Gallirallus is recognized based on available evidence. Sometimes split into 5 or 6 genera based on mitochondrial (Garcia-R et al. 2014) or genomic DNA (Kirchman et al. 2021) evidence. However, the presence of short internodes, relatively shallow branch lengths, and inconsistent support for relationships between datasets (see also Kirchman et al. 2012; Boast et al. 2019) suggest that species included in Aptenorallus, Habroptila, Eulabeornis, Cabalus, and Hypotaenidia are best subsumed in Gallirallus pending further research."	
3518	1129	Taxa immaculatus and tertius are treated as subspecies of Gallirallus woodfordi based on similarities in plumage and vocalizations. A more thorough analysis of vocalizations in conjunction with genetic data may be informative.	
3599	N-44	Porphyrio martinicus has also been used. Usage of martinica follows Schodde & Bock (2016).	
3602	1130	"The Porphyrio porphyrio complex is treated as a single polytypic species pending further research. Sometimes treated as six species based largely on mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Sangster 1998; Garcia-R & Trewick 2015; Verry et al. 2023) that indicate deep divergences and paraphyly with respect to the two species of takahe, P. mantelli and P. hochstetteri. Available nuclear DNA data (Garcia-R & Trewick 2015) are mostly uninformative and mtDNA divergence times may be over-estimated. Further research incorporating denser sampling of nuclear DNA will be needed to determine species limits in this complex."	
3653	1127	"Taxon tuerosi is treated as a subspecies of Laterallus jamaicensis pending completion of ongoing vocal and genetic research. Available mitochondrial DNA data (Depino et al. 2023) indicate the presence of two species groups within the L. jamaicensis complex, with tuerosi recovered as sister to L. spilonota. However, taxa salinasi and murivagans were not included in the analysis and their status remains uncertain."	
3660	1148	Taxon cinereus is placed in the monospecific genus Poliolimnas based on nuclear (Garcia-R et al. 2020) and genomic DNA (Kirchman et al. 2021) evidence. Sometimes placed in Amaurornis but recovered as a deeply diverged sister lineage to Megacrex from which it differs in morphology and ecology indicating that cinereus is best treated as a monotypic genus.	
3666	1133	"Taxon marginalis is placed in the genus Aenigmatolimnas based on nuclear (Garcia-R et al. 2020) and genomic DNA (Kirchman et al. 2021) evidence. Formerly placed in Amaurornis, deep divergence combined with differences in morphology, ecology, and biogeography indicate that marginalis is best treated as a monotypic genus."	
3738	953	"The new genus Hesperoburhinus (polytypic, including bistriatus and superciliaris) is recognized based on a very deep genetic divergence in the multilocus DNA phylogeny of _ern_ & Natale (2022)."	
3778	749	"Three species are recognized in the Himantopus himantopus (black and white stilts) complex pending further research: monotypic H. himantopus; monotypic H. leucocephalus; and polytypic H. mexicanus (including melanurus and knudseni). Although the all-black taxon (H. novaezelandiae) is widely accepted as a distinct species (as here), the number of species recognized among the five black-and-white taxa ranges from one to four. Genetic divergence across the genus appears to be low (Steeves et al. 2010; Forsdick et al. 2021), there is considerable uncertainty over levels of reproductive isolation across the complex (Steeves et al. 2010; Harvey et al. 2014; Forsdick et al. 2021), and detailed vocal studies are lacking. In the absence of a more comprehensive review, we continue to recognize the black-winged (nominate H. himantopus), pied (H. leucocephalus), and black-necked (H. mexicanus) groups."	
3791	750	"Taxon bachmani is treated as a monotypic species separate from Haematopus ater based on differences in bill shape and downy natal plumage (Murphy 1925), and preliminary mitochondrial DNA evidence that bachmani and ater may not be sister taxa (Senfeld et al. 2020)."	
3823	907	"Taxon cayanus is placed in the monospecific genus Hoploxypterus based on differences in morphology, osteology, and behavior that place it outside Vanellus (Fjeldså & Nielsen 1989; Livezey 2010). This treatment is supported by limited mitochondrial DNA data (_ern_ & Natale 2022), although the exact placement of H. cayanus remains unresolved."	
3827	1075	"Based mostly on the phylogenetic analyses of Dos Remedios et al. (2015) and _ern_ & Natale (2022), the expanded genus Charadrius is split into multiple genera: a monotypic Eudromias (E. morinellus); a reduced Charadrius (polytypic; C. vociferus, C. hiaticula, C. semipalmatus, and C. melodus); a monotypic Zonibyx (Z. modestus); a polytypic Thinornis (including T. cucullatus, T. melanops, T. novaeseelandiae, T. forbesi, T. tricollaris, T. dubius, and T. placidus); five monotypic genera not included in the phylogeny by Dos Remedios et al. (2015) (Phegornis, Oreopholus, Elseyornis, Erythrogonys, and Peltohyas); and a large polytypic Anarhynchus comprising the remaining species previously placed in Charadrius. Further research to refine generic limits in the Charadriidae will be needed."	
3849	910	Taxon bifrontatus is treated as a subspecies of Thinornis tricollaris based on available evidence. Although the two taxa differ in plumage and mitochondrial DNA (Dos Remedios et al. 2020) the levels are more consistent with subspecific differentiation. A more comprehensive analysis based on genomic DNA may be informative.	
3890	911	"Taxon novaehollandiae is treated as a subspecies of Vanellus miles based on available evidence. Although these taxa differ in plumage and size, and in mitochondrial DNA (Tizard et al. 2019), the presence of two broad zones of introgression, and an apparent absence of vocal differences, suggests they are best treated as conspecific pending further research."	
3908	707	"Taxon atrifrons (polytypic, including pamirensis and schaeferi) is treated as a species separate from Anarhynchus mongolus based on genomic DNA data, supported by vocalizations (Wei et al. 2022a)."	
3922	909	"Taxon aquilonius is treated as a subspecies of Anarhynchus obscurus based on available evidence. Mitochondrial DNA divergence is weak (Barth et al. 2013), and differences in plumage, proportions, ecology, and behavior are best considered subspecific. Loss of intermediate populations also means that clinality cannot be assessed, and differences in ecology and behavior might be explained by geography and climate."	
3953	933	"Taxon seebohmi is treated as a subspecies of Anarhynchus alexandrinus, as the evidentiary basis for a split is weak. Vocal differences between seebohmi and alexandrinus have not been documented; there are only minor morphometric differences between the two (Niroshan et al. 2023), for which clinal variation has not been ruled out; mitochondrial DNA divergence is negligible, and there is no support for seebohmi as the earliest-diverged lineage in this complex (Niroshan et al. 2023)."	
4009	912	"Taxon hudsonicus (polytypic, including rufiventris) is treated as a species separate from Numenius phaeopus based on morphology and deep genomic DNA divergence (McLaughlin et al. 2020; Tan et al. 2023). However, vocalizations seem similar, and a formal bioacoustic analysis is lacking."	
4106	913	"Taxon tricolor is placed in the genus Phalaropus, along with P. lobatus and P. fulicarius, based on strong support for monophyly of this group from mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Gibson & Baker 2012). However, tricolor is sometimes placed in the monospecific genus Steganopus based on obvious differences in morphology and ecology."	
4262	545	"Taxon africanus is placed in the monotypic genus Smutsornis based on multilocus DNA data (_ern_ & Natale 2022), supported by differences in behavior, downy chick patterning, and syringeal structure (Brown & Ward 1990)."	
4295	1160	Taxon isabella is placed in the genus Glareola rather than Stiltia based on the multilocus DNA data of _ern_ & Natale (2022) that show it to be embedded within Glareola.	
4309	895	"The single genus Stercorarius is recognized for skuas (sometimes placed in Catharacta) and jaegers based on mitochondrial DNA (Cohen et al. 1997; Andersson 1999b) and genomic evidence (Mikkelsen & Weir 2023), supported by plumage, behavioral, and feather parasite data. Mikkelsen & Weir (2023) provide evidence of mtDNA capture and nuclear introgression in the evolutionary history of this group, which accounts for discordant patterns in morphological, mitochondrial DNA, nuclear melanin-coding MC1R gene (Janssen & Mundy 2017), and genomic DNA-based reconstructions."	
4395	914	"Three species are recognized in the Gygis alba sensu lato complex based on differences in size, proportions, bill coloration, and vocalizations (Pratt 2020): monotypic G. alba; polytypic G. candida (including leucopes); and monotypic G. microrhyncha. Mitochondrial DNA data (Yeung et al. 2009; Thibault & Cibois 2017) indicate little divergence among these species, perhaps due to recent introgressive hybridisation; further research needed."	
4417	N-36	Anous albivittus has also been used. The name albivitta is a noun in apposition and hence inalienable. It should remain albivitta regardless of genus context.	
4465	989	"Taxon macrotarsa is treated as a monotypic species separate from Gelochelidon nilotica based mostly on differences in plumage, morphometrics, and ecology, supported by limited mitochondrial DNA data (Tavares & Baker 2008); further research would be informative."	
4485	915	"Taxon acuflavidus (polytypic, including eurygnathus) is treated as conspecific with Thalasseus sandvicensis based on available evidence. The apparent lack of vocal differences and complex patterns of phenotypic variation require further evaluation. Mitochondrial DNA data (Efe et al. 2009; Collinson et al. 2017) indicate paraphyly within T. sandvicensis but this might result from mtDNA capture as supporting genomic data are lacking. A comprehensive review of phenotypic and genetic variation in this complex is needed."	
4496	916	"Taxon albididorsalis is treated as a species separate from Thalasseus maximus based on differences in morphology and vocalizations (Dufour & Crochet 2020), as well as genetics (Collinson et al. 2017). Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data both indicate that T. maximus sensu lato is not monophyletic, with albididorsalis being more closely aligned with T. bengalensis."	
4537	1145	"Seven genera are recognized among the Larus gulls based on phylogenetic information obtained from nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (Pons et al. 2005; Sternkopf 2011; _ern_ & Natale 2022): polytypic Chroicocephalus; monotypic Saundersilarus, Hydrocoloeus and Rhodostethia; polytypic Leucophaeus, Ichthyaetus, and Larus. Circumscription of genera follows IOC14.2 and Clements v2023."	
4592	1144	"Taxon brachyrhynchus is treated as a monotypic species separate from Larus canus based on differences in display vocalizations and mitochondrial DNA divergence without evidence of introgression, supported by minor differences in morphology (Sternkopf 2011; Adriaens & Gibbins 2016)."	
4608	1136	"Four species are recognized in the Larus argentatus complex based on a combination of genetics, plumage, and vocalizations: polytypic L. argentatus (including argenteus); monotypic L. smithsonianus; monotypic L. vegae; and monotypic L. mongolicus. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data consistently support separation of L. smithsonianus from L. argentatus (Liebers et al. 2004; _ern_ & Natale 2022; Sternkopf et al. 2010; Sonsthagen et al. 2016), an arrangement also supported by differences in adult and juvenile plumage, and apparently vocalizations. Species L. vegae is sometimes considered a subspecies of L. smithsonianus but differs phenotypically at a level more consistent with species status in this complex. Finally, L. mongolicus was previously placed in L. cachinnans but is phenotypically distinct from that species and from L. vegae with which it is sometimes aligned; its vocalizations also appear to be the most distinctive of the species formerly placed in L. argentatus. A comprehensive genomic DNA analysis would be informative given the complex demographic and biogeographic history of this group."	
4711	709	"Taxon filholi is treated as a species separate from Eudyptes chrysocome based on genomic DNA divergence (Frugone et al. 2021), supported by differences in bare parts color and possibly other traits (e.g., eyebrow shape, species of feather lice). However, vocalizations of the two taxa seem similar and require formal assessment."	
4723	883	"Taxon sanfordi is treated as a monotypic species separate from Diomedea epomophora based primarily on differences in morphology and plumage, supported by mitochondrial DNA data (Robertson & Nunn 1998). However, occasional interbreeding has been reported and a more thorough investigation of gene flow and divergence across the main breeding populations is desirable."	
4725	882	"Four species are recognized in the Diomedea exulans complex based primarily on differences in morphology and plumage, supported by a combination of mitochondrial DNA (Burg & Croxall 2004; Chambers et al. 2009; Rains et al. 2011) and microsatellite data (Burg & Croxall 2004): D. exulans; D. dabbenena; D. antipodensis (polytypic, including gibsoni); and D. amsterdamensis. Furthermore, the geographic distribution of taxa indicates parapatry or partial sympatry between circumpolar exulans and the remaining subantarctic taxa."	
4735	886	"Taxon carteri is treated as a species separate from Thalassarche chlororhynchos based on differences in plumage, bill coloration and architecture, size, and mitochondrial DNA divergence (Chambers et al. 2009; Abeyrama et al. 2021). However, a low level of mtDNA introgression has been detected in carteri (Abeyrama et al. 2021) indicating that further research is warranted."	
4738	884	"Taxon impavida is treated as a subspecies of Thalassarche melanophris based on available evidence. Although the taxa can be separated based on mitochondrial DNA (Burg & Croxall 2001; Burg et al. 2017) and iris color, there is little evidence of assortative mating on Campbell Island where a few individuals of melanophris occur in the colony of impavida (Alderman et al. 2005). Further study using genomic techniques may clarify the situation."	
4744	885	"Taxon steadi is treated as a subspecies of Thalassarche cauta based on relatively minor differences in plumage, bill coloration, and size (Double et al. 2003), microsatellite data (Abbott & Double 2003a), and mitochondrial DNA (Abbott & Double 2003b; Chambers et al. 2009)."	
4850	892	"Taxon borealis is treated as a species separate from Calonectris diomedea based on differences in plumage, size, and vocalizations, supported by divergence in mitochondrial DNA (Gómez-Díaz et al. 2006, 2009), and mostly distinct microsatellite and olfactory chemical profiles (Zidat et al. 2017). Furthermore, despite occurring in sympatry in part of their range, interbreeding between these taxa is rare."	
4868	772	"Taxon mauretanicus is treated as a subspecies of Puffinus yelkouan based on analysis of genomic data (Ferrer Obiol et al. 2021, 2023), supported by mitochondrial DNA (Genovart et al. 2005, 2012), and phenotypic data (Genovart et al. 2012). Both mitochondrial DNA and genomic data indicate relatively low levels of differentiation, comparable to, or lower than, reported for P. puffinus subspecies (Genovart et al. 2005; Rodríguez et al. 2020; Ferrer Obiol et al. 2023), and provide evidence of gene flow between mauretanicus and yelkouan; phenotypic traits also show evidence of intermediacy and admixture in mauretanicus (Genovart et al. 2012). Although assortative mating and distinct vocalizations have been reported (Curé et al. 2010), the available evidence is insufficient to confirm species-level differences."	
4871	889	"Taxa boydi and baroli are treated as species separate from Puffinus lherminieri based on a combination of morphological, genomic (Ferrer Obiol et al. 2021, 2022), and multilocus DNA data (Torres et al. 2021). Although morphological characters align boydi with lherminieri, all genetic studies recover boydi and the distinctive-looking baroli as sister taxa, thus supporting a 3-species treatment."	
4907	894	"Taxon whenuahouensis is treated as a subspecies of Pelecanoides georgicus based on available evidence. Plumage differences are subtle, morphological traits considered diagnostic show considerable variation within taxa (Fischer et al. 2018), and mitochondrial DNA divergence is low (Grosser et al. 2021)."	
4935	890	"Extinct taxon caribbaea is treated as a monotypic species separate from Pterodroma hasitata based on consistent differences in plumage, tarsal coloration, size, and proportions, combined with data on mitochondrial DNA divergence (Manly et al. 2013) and feather lice. Sometimes considered a dark morph of hasitata, the combined evidence suggests that caribbaea is better treated as a separate species."	
4939	893	The extinct taxon rupinarum is placed in the genus Pterodroma based on the mitochondrial DNA data of Welch et al. (2014).	
4940	891	"Taxon deserta is treated as a species separate from Pterodroma feae based mostly on differences in breeding season and vocalizations, supported by morphological and mitochondrial DNA data (Jesus et al. 2009)."	
4957	888	Taxon occulta is treated as a subspecies of Pterodroma cervicalis as the evidentiary basis for a split is weak. Diagnostic plumage and morphological differences are lacking (Shirihai & Bretagnolle 2010) and comparative genetic and vocal material has not been analysed; further research warranted.	
5002	36	"Taxon microscelis (monotypic) is treated as a species separate from Ciconia episcopus (polytypic) based on consistent differences in morphology (including plumage) and biogeographic considerations, the taxa being allopatric on separate continents."	
5034	1185	"Taxon brewsteri (polytypic, including etesiaca) is treated as a species separate from Sula leucogaster based on differences in plumage, soft part colors, and behavior, including mostly assortative mating in sympatry (VanderWerf et al. 2023), combined with mitochondrial DNA divergence (Morris-Pocock et al. 2011)."	
5084	N-40	Nannopterum brasilianus was used in error by Clements et al. (2021). Nannopterum is neuter and the species name is an adjective which must be adjusted in gender accordingly.	
5095	N-43	"Leucocarbo bougainvillii has also been used. The Code article that applies here is 32.5.1: ""…If there is in the original publication itself, without recourse to any external source of information, clear evidence of an inadvertent error, such as a lapsus calami or a copyist's or printer's error, it must be corrected.

In this case, the ending must be corrected to plural as it turns out that the name is dedicated to two Bougainvilles, not one."	
5098	896	"Taxon stewarti is treated as a subspecies of Leucocarbo chalconotus based on the multilocus DNA analysis of Rawlence et al. (2022), supported by phenotypic data. Further analysis may show that L. onslowi should also be subsumed within L. chalconotus."	
5104	897	"Six taxa often previously considered species are treated as subspecies of Leucocarbo atriceps (polytypic, including verrucosus, nivalis, melanogenis, purpurascens, bransfieldensis, and georgianus) based on multilocus DNA evidence (Rawlence et al. 2022). Despite being widely separated on subantarctic islands and their sedentary nature, taxa in the L. atriceps complex are only weakly diverged in plumage and in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. An expanded L. atriceps is recognized pending further research on taxonomic limits within this complex."	
5124	898	"Taxon lucidus is treated as a subspecies of Phalacrocorax carbo based on available evidence. Sometimes split as a separate species, genetic studies (Marion & Le Gentil 2006; Kennedy & Spencer 2014; Ochiai et al. 2020; Baltz et al. 2021), based mostly on mitochondrial DNA, show relationships within P. carbo to be poorly resolved and that P. capillatus might also be part of this group (see Kennedy & Spencer 2014) albeit based on an unvouchered specimen. Further work is needed to assess the taxonomic status of P. capillatus, which has long been considered morphologically and ecologically distinctive."	
5194	314	"Taxon gigantea is placed in the genus Pseudibis (polytypic, including papillosa and davisoni) as justification for its treatment as a monotypic genus is lacking. Genetic data would be informative."	
5212	N-39	Threskiornis moluccus has also been used. Usage of molucca follows Schodde & Bock (2016).	
5262	1205	"Ixobrychus is merged into Botaurus pending further research to confirm generic and subgeneric limits in this complex. Genetic evidence from genomic (Hruska et al. 2023) and mitochondrial DNA data (Päckert et al. 2014) indicate that Ixobrychus is not a monophyletic group; both exilis and involucris are aligned with Botaurus despite plumage, size, and vocalizations suggesting they form a clade with B. [I]. minutus."	
5293	899	"Gorsachius is treated as 3 genera based on the genomic and mitochondrial DNA data of Hruska et al. (2023): monospecific Calherodius (C. leuconotus) and monospecific Oroanassa (O. magnifica), with taxa goisagi and melanolophus retained in Gorsachius. Although Hruska et al. (2023) proposed combining leuconotus and magnificus in Calherodius, these taxa are deeply diverged and occur on different continents, prompting treatment as separate genera."	
5325	905	"Taxon dimorpha is treated as a subspecies of Egretta garzetta (polytypic, including Australasian immaculata) based on available evidence. Sometimes split as a separate species, or treated as a subspecies of gularis, based largely on the presence of a dark morph, the bare parts color and bill form suggest that dimorpha is better treated as a subspecies of E. garzetta. Furthermore, the name nigripes is considered invalid (nigripes=immaculata) as some syntypes appear to be of hybrid origin, and phenotypic intermediacy suggests widespread intergradation between garzetta and immaculata in the Sundaic region."	
5358	1171	"Four species are recognized in the Butorides striata complex based on the genomic DNA evidence of Mendales (2023): monotypic B. sundevalli from Galapagos; polytypic B. virescens from North America; monotypic B. striata from South America; and a polytypic Old World B. atricapilla group. While further splits in the B. atricapilla group may be warranted, genetic sampling was too geographically limited to properly assess these; further research needed."	
5404	904	"Three monotypic species are recognized in the Ardea intermedia sensu lato complex based on differences in breeding bare parts color, plumage, and morphology, and possibly in display and vocalizations: A. intermedia; A. brachyrhyncha; and A. plumifera. However, genetic data are lacking and further work is needed to corroborate this split."	
5407	"902, 1187"	Taxon coromanda is treated as a species separate from Ardea ibis based on consistent differences in proportions and breeding plumage. A comprehensive genetic review is needed. Bubulcus is merged into Ardea based on the genomic DNA evidence of Hruska et al. (2023).	
5425	903	"Taxon occidentalis is treated as a subspecies of Ardea herodias based on available evidence. Microsatellite data (McGuire et al. 2019) indicate a considerable degree of introgression despite differences in plumage color and other morphological characters. Although mitochondrial DNA data (Cheek et al. 2018) demonstrate a lack of differentiation among the blue-plumaged subspecies (herodias, fannini, and wardi), occidentalis has not yet been sampled. Further research is needed including an assessment of bare parts color during breeding (Browning & Kushlan 2022)."	
5431	1183	"The Caprimulgiformes sensu lato are treated as six orders based on evidence of ancient genetic divergences obtained from densely sampled nuclear DNA (Prum et al. 2015) and genomic data (Stiller et al. 2024), combined with the great morphological and ecological diversity represented within the group: Apodiformes (Hemiprocnidae, Apodidae, Trochilidae); Steatornithiformes (Steatornithidae); Nyctibiiformes (Nyctibiidae); Podargiformes (Podargidae); Caprimulgiformes (Caprimulgidae); and Aegotheliformes (Aegothelidae). However, recognition of an expanded Caprimulgiformes would also be valid and would retain information on the common evolutionary history of these divergent lineages."	
5481	1199	"Widespread non-monophyly in some New World caprimulgids (Han et al. 2010; Sigur_sson & Cracraft 2014) is resolved through recognition of eight genera based mostly on the recommendations of Costa et al. (2023): Tepuiornis whitelyi; polytypic Uropsalis (U. segmentata and U. lyra); Quechuavis decussata; polytypic Setopagis (S. heterura, S. maculosa, and S. parvula); Antiurus maculicaudus; polytypic Hydropsalis (H. forcipata, H. cayennensis, H. climacocerca, and H. torquata); Systellura longirostris; and polytypic Eleothreptus (E. candicans and E. anomalus)."	
5498	519	"Taxon roraimae is retained as a subspecies of Systellura longirostris based on available genetic evidence (Sigur_sson & Cracraft 2014). Vocalizations are distinctly different (Spencer 2010), but a more comprehensive analysis of genetics and bioacoustics across all taxa in this complex is needed before implementing any splits."	
5559	520	Taxon ekmani is split from Antrostomus cubanensis based on vocal differences between the two taxa (Garrido & Reynard 1998).	
5613	524	In the absence of genetic data the morphologically distinct taxon binotatus (Holyoak 2001; Cleere 2010) is retained in the monotypic genus Veles.	
5628	521	Caprimulgus centralasicus is a synonym of C. europaeus based on genetic analysis of the holotype (and sole specimen) (Schweizer et al. 2020a). It probably represents an example of subspecies plumipes but cannot be assigned with confidence based on available morphological and genetic data.	
5657	1220	"Caprimulgus ritae (Timor Nightjar) is recognized as a new species based on differences in vocalizations and morphology, supported by mitochondrial DNA data, following King et al. (2024)."	
5668	522	"Taxon nigriscapularis is treated as a subspecies of Caprimulgus pectoralis due to overlap in vocalizations (Dowsett & Dowsett-Lemaire 1993) and morphometrics (Jackson 2013), and minimal plumage differences (Louette 1990). Limited genetic data confirm monophyly of this group, with nigriscapularis as the most divergent lineage (Han et al. 2010); due to limited genomic sampling and potential mitochondrial DNA introgression, further genetic studies are desirable."	
5674	523	Taxon ruwenzorii is considered not specifically distinct from Caprimulgus poliocephalus based on vocal similarities (Dowsett & Dowsett-Lemaire 1993) and the absence of significant plumage and morphometric differences between the two (Louette 1990; Jackson 2014).	
5691	708	"Taxon griseatus (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Caprimulgus affinis based on vocalizations (Sangster et al. 2021a). Although Sangster et al. (2021a) proposed a 3-way split, vocal differences between monticolus and affinis are less pronounced, and show some overlap. Little-known taxon mindanensis (if valid) is treated as a subspecies of C. griseatus based on geography, but was not sampled and future analyses might find that it forms a link between griseatus and affinis. Further research needed as differences in plumage, genetics, and biometrics remain undescribed."	
5729	323	"Taxon bracteatus is placed in the monotypic genus Phyllaemulor based on combined behavioral, morphological, osteological, and genetic evidence. P. bracteatus is morphologically distinctive and has been recovered as basal to Nyctibius based on analyses of osteological characters (Costa et al. 2018, 2021). Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data (Braun & Huddleston 2009) also recovered Phyllaemulor as a deeply divergent lineage but exact relationships remain poorly resolved; more extensive genomic sampling is needed to determine generic limits in this group."	
5777	544	"Batrachostomus javensis sensu lato is split into three species based on vocal differences (Eaton et al. 2016): B. affinis (polytypic, also including continentalis); B. javensis (monotypic); and B. chaseni (monotypic)."	
5792	526	"Taxon archboldi and taxon salvadorii is synonymized with Aegotheles albertisi, which is treated as a monotypic species, following Beehler & Pratt (2016). Although archboldi and salvadorii are sometimes split as species separate from A. albertisi (Cleere 2010; Dickinson & Remsen 2013), but based on mitochondrial DNA evidence relationships are shallow and remain poorly resolved (Dumbacher et al. 2003). Furthermore, archboldi and salvadorii are not maintained as subspecies, since the information on vocalizations of each taxon are uncertain, known phenotypic differences are minimal, and plumage is often quite variable even within a subspecific taxon within Aegotheles.

"	
5798	525	"Taxon terborghi is treated as a monotypic species separate from Aegotheles bennettii and A. affinis based on available evidence. This recently rediscovered taxon (Lagerqvist et al. 2017) is sometimes treated as a subspecies of A. bennettii based on similarities in plumage and geography, but is distinguished by its larger size and montane habitat. Mitochondrial DNA data (Dumbacher et al. 2003) also place terborghi closer to the geographically distant A. affinis from montane Vogelkop, rather than lowland A. bennettii."	
5964	946	"Taxa melba and aequatorialis are placed in the genus Tachymarptis rather than Apus based on the multilocus DNA data of Päckert et al. (2012), supported by morphological evidence (Brooke 1972). Although these two species differ from Apus in foot structure of newly-hatched chicks (Brooke 1972) a comprehensive review of this trait in Apus is lacking and the level of genetic divergence is not inconsistent with melba and aequatorialis being retained in Apus; further research would be informative."	
5989	"936, 1190"	"936)) Taxa salimalii and leuconyx are treated as subspecies of Apus pacificus pending further research. Although salimalii, leuconyx, cooki and pacificus are sometimes split into four species based on plumage and morphometrics (Leader 2011), many of the differences are subtle or not necessarily diagnostic. 1190)) Arguably the most distinctive taxon within Apus pacificus and a candidate for full species status, taxon cooki is retained as a subspecies of Apus pacificus pending further research. While mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Päckert et al. 2012) suggest that cooki is closer to Apus acuticauda than it is to nominate pacificus, not all taxa in the complex were sampled, and thus a split is considered premature. However, vocalizations of cooki appear to differ markedly from pacificus, and this issue will require reconsideration for a future version of AviList."	
6019	935	"Taxon sladeniae is treated as a subspecies of Apus barbatus based on available evidence. Sometimes recognized as a species based on color and subtle plumage differences (Brooke 1970; De Roo 1970), but the complex as a whole is phenotypically variable. A split is considered premature pending a comprehensive analysis of the complex, preferably with genetic data."	
6041	949	"Taxon dodgei is treated as a monotypic species separate from Collocalia linchi based on a combination of mitochondrial DNA divergence, smaller size, and plumage differences (Moyle et al. 2008; Rheindt et al. 2017)."	
6042	950	"Collocalia esculenta is split into eight species following Rheindt et al. (2017): C. natalis (monotypic); C. affinis (polytypic); C. marginata (polytypic); C. isonota (polytypic); C. sumbawae (polytypic); C. neglecta (polytypic); C. esculenta (polytypic); and C. uropygialis (polytypic), based on a combination of mitochondrial DNA divergence (see also Moyle et al. 2008), plumage, and other aspects of morphology. Analysis of genomic DNA would be informative in this phenotypically conservative complex."	
6094	948	"Taxa sororum and ceramensis are treated as subspecies of Aerodramus infuscatus pending publication of ongoing genomic research. Sometimes split based on differences in rump color and pattern (Rheindt & Hutchinson 2007) but the taxonomic significance of plumage variation in Aerodramus swiftlets is unclear. Although mitochondrial DNA data (Cibois et al. 2018a) align sororum with the fuciphagus-salangana group of species, ceramensis and infuscatus were not included in the study."	
6126	1181	"Taxon orientalis (polytypic, including leletensis) is treated as a species separate from Aerodramus vanikorensis based on available evidence. However, traits used to diagnose A. orientalis (tarsal feathering, pale rump, and gloss) appear to be present in some populations of A. vanikorensis (Tarburton 2018); genetic data will be needed to determine species limits in this complex."	
6129	947	"Taxon amelis (polytypic, including palawanensis) is treated as a species separate from Aerodramus vanikorensis based, in part, on mitochondrial DNA data (Price et al. 2005; Cibois et al. 2018a) that recovered vanikorensis as polyphyletic. Although nominate amelis has not been sampled, taxon palawanensis is not part of the vanikorensis clade centred in the Bismarck and Solomon archipelagos. Publication of ongoing genomic research should provide additional insights on species limits in this group."

6157	951	Taxon ocistus (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Aerodramus leucophaeus based on available evidence. There is modest divergence in mitochondrial DNA (Cibois et al. 2018a) among all three taxa but plumage and morphological differences are relatively small; further research needed.	
6165	952	"Taxon germani (polytypic, including amechanus) is treated as conspecific with Aerodramus fuciphagus pending publication of ongoing genomic research. Although aligned with the fuciphagus-salangana-infuscatus group based on mitochondrial DNA data (Earl of Cranbrook et al. 2013; Cibois et al. 2018a), taxon germani was not recovered as monophyletic, and the significance of plumage variation in Aerodramus swiftlets is unclear."	
6181	309	"AOS genus-level revisions for the Trochilidae are adopted based on the genetic studies of McGuire et al. (2009, 2014), and classifications proposed by Stiles et al. (2017a, b)."	
6210	278	"Taxon loehkeni (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of T. niger based on limited evidence. Sometimes treated as a subspecies of T. leucurus (Hinkelmann et al. 2020), loehkeni aligns more closely with T. niger based on tail pattern; further research into species and subspecies limits in this complex is needed."	
6236	280	"Taxon baroni (monotypic) is retained as a subspecies of Phaethornis longirostris, as the evidentiary basis for a split is considered weak. Minor differences in plumage and size (Piacentini 2011) are not sufficiently diagnostic, as these traits vary clinally within the broader longirostris group. Male lek vocalizations are reported to be distinct but are insufficiently studied; more thorough genetic, vocal, and morphological studies are required."	
6273	282	"Taxon porcullae (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Phaethornis griseogularis (polytypic) based on available evidence. Although the plumage of porcullae is paler than that of nominate griseogularis, subspecies zonura is geographically and phenotypically intermediate (Zimmer 1950). Further research needed to determine if this pattern is clinal variation or evidence of introgression; analysis of vocalizations would be especially informative."	
6316	283	"Taxon cyanotus (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Colibri thalassinus (monotypic) based on plumage and genetics. Differences in ventral plumage between thalassinus and nominate cyanotus are clear and consistent, although plumages in the geographically intermediate cabanidis appear more variable. Species status for cyanotus is also supported by large differences in mitochondrial DNA (Quintero & Perktas 2018) and an absence of mitochondrial DNA gene flow from P. cyanotus (Hernandez-Soto et al. 2018); further research on species limits in this complex is needed."	
6352	304	"Taxon iridescens (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Anthracothorax nigricollis based on similarities in male plumage, and biogeographic considerations. Further research is needed to define species limits in this group and may support species status for iridescens (Freile & Restall 2018)."	
6362	285	Taxon aurulentus is treated as a monotypic species separate from Anthracothorax dominicus (monotypic) based on differences in morphology and male plumage; tail patterns of females may also differ (Ridgway 1911). Mitochondrial-dominated DNA data show these taxa to be clearly separable (Lelevier 2008); further research warranted.	
6390	289	"Taxon sapphiropygia (polytypic, including catharina) is treated as conspecific with Eriocnemis luciani, as plumage differences (tail shape and female ventral coloration) are minor and mosaic-like within this complex. Genetic data are needed to determine species limits in this group."	
6430	290	"Coeligena torquata sensu lato is treated as three species based on plumage and genetics: C. torquata (polytypic); C. inca (polytypic, including omissa); and C. conradii (monotypic). Plumage differences among all three are substantial and mitochondrial DNA data (Parra et al. 2009; McGuire et al. 2014) separate torquata and inca at species level; genetic data for conradii, and the less distinctive eisenmanni, are lacking. Further research is needed to determine species limits in this complex."	
6440	292	"The monotypic taxa dichroura, albicaudata, and osculans are treated as subspecies of Coeligena violifer based on available evidence. Differences in plumage do not provide clear taxonomic indications, although the lack of a ""starfrontlet"" in violifer may be significant. Mitochondrial DNA data (Parra et al. 2009) show divergence of violifer from dichroura at subspecies level, but data for albicaudata and osculans are lacking; further research needed."	
6457	291	"Coeligena bonapartei sensu lato is treated as three monotypic species based on considerable differences in plumage: C. bonapartei; C. eos; and C. consita. Genetic patterns are complex; while eos is separable based on low mitochondrial DNA divergence, bonapartei and consita form a complex with C. helianthea, with haplotypes shared across all three species (Palacios et al. 2019). Limited genomic data also show C. helianthea embedded within this complex as the sister clade to bonapartei (Palacios et al. 2019), indicating genome-wide paraphyly and a history of hybridization; further research is needed."	
6480	293	"Ocreatus underwoodii sensu lato is treated as three species based on the morphological and behavioral differences (Schuchmann et al. 2016), although further research on courtship displays is needed: O. underwoodii (polytypic); O. addae (polytypic, including annae); and O. peruanus (monotypic). Genetic data are limited but indicate a relatively deep mitochondrial DNA divergence between addae and underwoodii (McGuire et al. 2014); further research needed. (After this AviList decision was finalized, AOS-SACC voted (https://www.museum.lsu.edu/~Remsen/SACCprop989.htm) to treat addae and peruanus as conspecific with underwoodii; AviList will reconsider this issue for version 2.)"	
6497	1222	Clytolaema is subsumed into Heliodoxa based on paraphyly in the multilocus DNA data of McGuire et al. (2014).	
6503	294	"Taxon whitelyana (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Heliodoxa schreibersii based on minor differences in plumage and (probably) female tail length, and the lack of supporting genetic or biological data; further research warranted."	
6556	287	"Heliangelus zusii is not recognized as a species based on genetic evidence that it is a hybrid between Aglaiocercus kingii and an unknown taxon. Mitochondrial DNA data place zusii within a clade of A. kingii from the Colombian Andes (Pérez-Emán et al. 2018) along with the phenotypically similar ""Rogitama Hummingbird"", identified as a Metallura tyrianthina x A. kingii hybrid (Stiles & Cortés-Herrera 2015; Pérez-Emán et al. 2018)."	
6558	286	Heliangelus amethysticollis sensu lato is treated as three species based on substantial differences in vocalizations (Donegan et al. 2015) and consistent variation in plumage characters (color and size of frons): H. amethysticollis (polytypic); H. spencei (monotypic); and H. clarisse (polytypic). Genetic data are limited and fragmentary (Altshuler et al. 2004; McGuire et al. 2014; Ornelas et al. 2014); further research needed.	
6668	288	"Taxon albolimbata is treated as a subspecies of Oreonympha nobilis based on available evidence. While plumage characters potentially linked to species recognition (color of the gorget and tail pattern) are similar, the superciliaries are strikingly different (Berlioz 1938). Vocal and genetic data are needed."	
6715	298	"Taxon cinereicauda is treated as a subspecies of Lampornis castaneoventris based on plumage and genetics. Analyses of mitochondrial-dominated DNA data place the white-throated castaneoventris and cinereicauda in a shallow, unresolved clade with the purple-throated L. calolaemus (García-Moreno et al. 2006; McGuire et al. 2014). Further research needed to determine species limits in this group, including assessment of introgression and admixture at contact zones."	
6721	297	"Taxon spectabilis is treated as a monotypic species separate from Eugenes fulgens (monotypic) based on differences in plumage (Renner & Schuchmann 2004), genetics (Zamudio-Beltrán & Hernández-Baños 2015), and vocalizations; formal bioacoustic analyses are lacking."	
6817	308	"Taxon elegans is removed from Riccordia bracei and treated as a taxon of uncertain status pending further research. Described from a single specimen of uncertain provenance, elegans differs from bracei in morphology (Weller 1999) and should not be considered conspecific. However, genetic data are needed to accurately assign species status."	
6822	296	"Cynanthus latirostris sensu lato is treated as three species based on plumage and genetics: C. latirostris (polytypic); C. doubledayi (monotypic); and C. lawrencei (monotypic). A combined analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA did not recover C. latirostris sensu lato as monophyletic but placed the phenotypically distinct doubledayi as sister to C. auriceps (Hernández-Baños et al. 2020). Species status for lawrencei is less clear; despite differences in plumage, genetic divergence from latirostris is relatively shallow (Hernández-Baños et al. 2020)."	
6835	303	"Taxon melanorhynchus (with pumilus as a synonym) is treated as a monotypic species separate from Chlorostilbon mellisugus (polytypic) based on genetics. Combined analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA data (McGuire et al. 2014; Hernández-Baños et al. 2020) do not recover these taxa as monophyletic, albeit based on limited geographic sampling. Differences in plumage are less definitive."	
6852	302	"Taxon alice is treated as a monotypic species separate from Chlorostilbon poortmani (polytypic) based on available evidence. Usually treated as separate species since Peters (1945), and possibly forming a species complex with C. stenurus, further research is needed to determine species limits for these data-deficient taxa."	
6870	307	"Taxa pampa and excellens are treated as subspecies of Pampa curvipennis based on genetics and vocalizations. Sometimes treated as separate species, divergences in microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA data (González et al. 2011) are more consistent with intraspecific differentiation. Playback experiments showed only minor differences in response between pampa and curvipennis, and none between excellens and curvipennis (Cruz-Yepez et al. 2020)."	
6914	306	"Taxon intermedia is treated as a subspecies of Chalybura buffonii based on similarities in plumage, especially tail color. Sometimes placed in C. urochrysia (as advocated by Schuchmann 1999) based on soft part colors, these are more variable than previously documented. Vocalizations of intermedia may differ from those of both species; further research warranted."	
6994	284	"Taxon scitulus (monotypic) is treated as a species separate from Trochilus polytmus (monotypic) based on differences in bill color, and the presence of a narrow and stable hybrid zone between them (Gill et al. 1973; Graves 2015). Genomic data separate these recently diverged taxa (McCormack et al. 2012; Judy 2018) but mitochondrial DNA differences are negligible (McGuire et al. 2014; Abrahamczyk et al. 2015)."	
6996	1221	Ramosomyia replaces Leucolia following Bruce & Stiles (2021) who showed the latter name to be a junior synonym of Leucippus and therefore unavailable.	
7000	301	"Taxon wagneri is treated as a subspecies of Ramosomyia viridifrons based on similarities in voice (Howell & Webb 1995) and genetics (Rodríguez-Gómez & Ornelas 2015, 2018). Additionally, subspecies villadai appears to be more differentiated than wagneri; further research on species limits in this group is warranted."	
7008	295	"Taxon hoffmanni is treated as a monotypic species separate from Saucerottia saucerottei (polytypic) based on genetics and vocalizations. Combined analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA data (McGuire et al. 2014) did not recover S. saucerottei sensu lato as monophyletic, a pattern consistent with reports that saucerottei and hoffmanni differ strikingly in voice and behavior (Stiles & Skutch 1989). Further research is needed to determine if hoffmanni is conspecific with S. beryllina or S. cyanura (see Jiménez & Ornelas 2016)."	
7030	300	Taxon cupreicauda (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Saucerottia viridigaster (polytypic) based on differences in plumage following Weller (2000). Genetic data would be informative.	
7046	305	Amazilia alfaroana is not recognized as a species pending further research. Described from a single specimen and possibly of hybrid origin; genetic data are needed to determine if it is a valid species.	
7092	1203	"Taxon boucardi is placed in the genus Chrysuronia, rather than in Amazilia, based on the multilocus DNA data of Albertazzi et al. (2024)."	
7110	299	"Taxon bartletti (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Chionomesa lactea (polytypic) based on available evidence.

Sometimes treated as a distinct species, variation in plumage characters suggests it is a rufous color-morph (Clark 2003) or subspecies of B. augur (Clark 1996). Genetic data for archeri are uninformative, being limited to a short section of mitochondrial DNA (Riesing et al. 2003) of uncertain provenance; although aligned with a group that includes augur and rufofuscus, the position of archeri remains poorly resolved."

Conversely, limited mitochondrial DNA data align bannermani with B. rufinus (Clouet & Wink 2000; Kruckenhauser et al. 2004) and there is evidence of genetic introgression within B. buteo and related species (Jowers et al. 2019); further research needed."

Additionally, phylogenetic relationships among these genera remain unresolved."	
8779	929	"Taxon roseigaster is placed in the genus Priotelus rather than Temnotrogon based on available evidence. Mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Moyle 2005; Hosner et al. 2010) recovered P. roseigaster and P. temnurus as deeply diverged sister taxa with strong support. Although they also differ substantially in plumage and vocalizations, we consider it more informative to recognize a single genus with two species, an arrangement supported by biogeography and deep genetic intra-generic divergences being typical in trogons."

Vocalizations reportedly also differ between the three groups but a formal bioacoustic analysis is lacking."	
8815	931	"Taxon aurantius is treated as a subspecies of Trogon surrucura based on available evidence. Despite differences in plumage, vocalizations are not known to differ, mitochondrial DNA divergence is weak (DaCosta 2006), and there is evidence of hybridization (Santos 2012); however, areas of local sympatry have also been reported (Falcão et al. 2017). Further research into their interactions across the contact zone will be needed to clarify species status for aurantius."	
8818	927	"Trogon rufus is split into four species based largely on the integrative study of plumage, morphometrics, vocalizations, and mitochondrial DNA data by Dickens et al.

Although mitochondrial DNA data support placement of muriciensis in T. chrysochloros, some vocal and plumage traits suggest its affinities may lie elsewhere within this complex or warrant recognition as a full species, as proposed by Dickens et al. (2021); further research needed."	
8827	930	"Taxon ambiguus (polytypic, including canescens and goldmani) is treated as a species separate from Trogon elegans based on differences in plumage and vocalizations, supported by modest mitochondrial DNA divergence (DaCosta & Klicka 2008). Further research, including a formal bioacoustic analysis, is needed to confirm this split."	
8861	310	"Taxon africana (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Upupa epops (polytypic) based on minor plumage differences, contiguous ranges, and a lack of vocal differences (Dowsett & Dowsett-Lemaire 1993)."	
8874	312	"Taxon castaneiceps is placed in the genus Rhinopomastus based on similarities in vocal and social behavior (Dowsett-Lemaire & Dowsett 2014). Sometimes placed in Phoeniculus based on plumage, castaneiceps reportedly lacks the rattle call typical of this genus; genetic and bioacoustic analyses needed."

8907	1177	"Bucorvus is placed in Bucerotidae rather than Bucorvidae based on available mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data (Viseshakul et al. 2011; Gonzalez et al. 2013), and obvious morphological affinities with other hornbills. Although forming a divergent clade, Bucorvus was recovered as part of a basal polytomy by Viseshakul et al. (2011), and clade ages may be substantially over-estimated."	
8915	691	"Taxon semifasciatus is treated as a species separate from Lophoceros fasciatus based on differences in plumage as well as bill color and pattern, and a hybrid zone of limited extent (Louette 1981; Marchant 1953). Although mitochondrial DNA data (Gonzalez et al. 2013) indicate deep divergences within this complex, a more comprehensive genetic review is needed to verify this result."	
8932	690	"Five species are recognized in the Tockus erythrorhynchus complex based on a combination of plumage, bare parts color, vocalizations, genetics (Kemp & Delport 2002; Viseshakul et al. 2011; Gonzalez et al. 2013), and hybrid zone dynamics (Delport et al. 2004): T. erythrorhynchus; T. ruahae; T. kempi; T. rufirostris; and T. damarensis. Mitochondrial DNA data (Gonzalez et al. 2013) suggested that these may divide into two groups: northern erythrorhynchus, kempi, and ruahae and southern rufirostris and damarensis. Further research is needed in areas of parapatry to assess levels of gene flow and a more comprehensive genetic review would be informative."	
8940	694	"Taxon cassini is treated as a monotypic species separate from Horizocerus albocristatus (polytypic) on the basis of differences in facial and wing coloration, bill morphology, and mitochondrial DNA divergence (Gonzalez et al. 2013)."	
8944	695	Taxon granti is treated as a monotypic species separate from Horizocerus hartlaubi based mostly on differences in bill architecture and mitochondrial DNA divergence (Gonzalez et al. 2013); further research would be informative.	
8957	697	"Taxon sharpii (polytypic) is treated as a subspecies of Bycanistes fistulator based on available evidence. Morphological differences are slight, some traits (e.g., bill color) are variable within taxa (Dowsett-Lemaire & Dowsett 2014, 2019), and their behavior (including voice) and ecology are similar. Preliminary mitochondrial DNA data (Gonzalez et al. 2013) indicate substantial divergence within the range of sharpii; further research needed to assess levels of gene flow between these taxa."	
8962	693	"Taxon vigil is placed in the monospecific genus Rhinoplax based on its phenotypic uniqueness, although its phylogenetic placement based on limited nuclear and mitochondrial DNA data remains unresolved (Viseshakul et al. 2011; González et al. 2013)."	
8964	692	"Taxon mindanensis (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Buceros hydrocorax, as the evidentiary basis for a split is considered weak (Kemp 1995) and levels of mitochondrial DNA divergence (Campbell 2013; Gonzalez et al. 2013) are more consistent with subspecific differentiation in hornbills."	
9013	696	"Taxon samarensis is treated as a monotypic species separate from Penelopides affinis (polytypic) based on levels of mitochondrial DNA divergence (Gonzalez et al. 2013). Further research is needed as genetic data are limited, phenotypic differences are minor, and no evidence of behavioral or ecological differences has been presented in support of this treatment."	
9019	34	"Taxon squamiger is placed in the monotypic genus Geobiastes based on genetics. Brachypteracias sensu lato was not recovered as monophyletic by mitochondrial DNA (Kirchman et al. 2001) or genomic (McCullough et al. 2019) data, with squamiger basal to a clade containing B. leptosomus, Atelornis, and Uratelornis."	
9089	264	"Taxon lafresnayii is treated as a monotypic species separate from Merops variegatus (polytypic) based on plumage, size, vocalizations, and habitat. Sometimes treated as conspecific with montane M. oreobates but differs in plumage, and possibly vocalizations; occasional reports of intermediacy in some plumage traits (Turner 2010) requires investigation. Genetic data needed to affirm species limits in this complex."	
9114	266	"Taxon americanus is treated as a monotypic species separate from Merops viridis based on plumage (Collar 2011) and genetics. Although mitochondrial DNA differences are moderate (Marks et al. 2007), the abrupt transition in plumage without obvious clinality suggests species-level divergence. Vocally similar, but formal analyses are lacking."	
9116	265	"Merops orientalis sensu lato is treated as three polytypic species based on differences in plumage: M. orientalis; M. viridissimus; and M. cyanophrys. Mitochondrial DNA COI barcodes (Khan et al. 2010; Schindel et al. 2011) support separation of orientalis and cyanophrys, but data for viridissimus are not available. Vocalizations have not been analyzed."	
9225	252	"Taxa thomensis and nais are treated as subspecies of Corythornis cristatus based on adult plumage and genetics. Sometimes treated as separate species, or subspecies of C. leucogaster, mitochondrial DNA data (Melo & Fuchs 2008) show that both taxa are closely related to C. cristatus. While adults are generally similar in morphology, juvenile thomensis show striking differences in size and plumage. Further research, including genomic DNA analyses, is warranted."	
9232	254	"Taxon peninsulae is treated as a monotypic species separate from Alcedo euryzona based on differences in plumage and biogeographic considerations. The abrupt transition in plumage characters, without evidence of clinality between them, suggests an extended period of parapatry considered indicative of species status."	
9264	246	"Taxon nigrirostris is treated as a subspecies of Ceyx cyanopectus based on available evidence. Although mitochondrial DNA data (Andersen et al. 2018) did not recover these as monophyletic, the placement of nigrirostris is uncertain due to issues of sequence length and quality. Differences in plumage and size are modest, and vocalizations have not been rigorously analyzed. Further research is warranted."	
9279	250	"Taxon rufidorsa is treated as a species separate from Ceyx erithaca based on a combined analysis of plumage, morphometrics, and genetics (Lim et al. 2010a). Extensive plumage polymorphism in this complex appears to be the result of past introgression but the two species can be distinguished by mantle color, which is black in erithaca and rusty-brown in rufidorsa. Mitochondrial DNA data and morphometrics also segregate according to mantle color, a pattern consistent with species-level recognition."	
9288	251	"Taxon mindanensis (monotypic) is treated as conspecific with Ceyx melanurus (polytypic) based on available evidence. Plumage differences are minor, variation in morphology (size) is clinal, and divergence in mitochondrial DNA is relatively low (Andersen et al. 2013; Hosner et al. 2014). Nonetheless, the distinctiveness of mindanensis is supported by limited nuclear DNA data (Andersen et al. 2013, 2018); further research is warranted."	
9292	253	The extinct taxon sangirensis is treated as a monotypic species separate from Ceyx fallax based on differences in plumage and size (Collar & Martin 2024). Represented by three specimens with some uncertainty about their provenance; genetic data needed.	
9296	247	"Taxon uropygialis (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Ceyx lepidus based on available evidence. Although mitochondrial DNA data (Andersen et al. 2013, 2018) revealed a relatively deep divergence between these taxa, similarity in plumage and vocalizations suggests they are best treated as conspecific pending further research."	
9305	248	Taxon pallidus is treated as a subspecies of Ceyx meeki based on the available evidence. Plumages are nearly identical and mitochondrial DNA data (Andersen et al. 2018) recovered pallidus as sister to meeki with modest divergence.	
9308	249	Taxon malaitae is treated as a subspecies of Ceyx nigromaxilla based on minor differences in plumage and bill color described from a single specimen. Although occurring on adjacent islands mitochondrial DNA (Andersen et al. 2018) did not recover them as monophyletic; a more comprehensive analysis of genetics and morphology is needed.	
9348	255	"Taxon melanops (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Lacedo pulchella (polytypic) based on available evidence. Vocalizations appear to be indistinguishable and plumage (male head band color) is highly variable within melanops, ranging from black to chestnut. This contrasts with the deep mitochondrial DNA divergence reported between these taxa, a pattern also supported by nuclear DNA data (Andersen et al. 2018). Further research is needed to resolve these inconsistencies, including formal bioacoustic analyses and determination of the basis for plumage polymorphism in melanops."	
9411	256	"Taxon gularis is treated as a monotypic species separate from Halcyon smyrnensis (polytypic) based on differences in plumage, and genetics. Combined analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data (Andersen et al. 2018) do not recover gularis and smyrnensis as monophyletic, with mtDNA providing strong support for a sister relationship between gularis and cyanoventris; a more comprehensive genetic review of this complex would be informative."	
9419	263	"Taxon sanghirensis is treated as a monotypic species separate from Cittura cyanotis based on differences in plumage, size, and genetics (Andersen et al. 2018); apparent vocal differences (Eaton et al. 2021) require documentation."	
9455	336	"The genus Clytoceyx (monotypic) is included in Dacelo, as a combined analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA data showed Clytoceyx to be nested within Dacelo (Andersen et al. 2018)."	
9473	257	"Taxon excelsus (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Actenoides bougainvillei based on similarities in plumage, shallow mitochondrial DNA divergence (Andersen et al. 2018), and anecdotal evidence of playback response. Both taxa are poorly known and described from a limited number of specimens; further research would be informative."	
9484	258	"Taxon capucinus (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Actenoides monachus based on available evidence. Despite clear differences in head and tail color, evidence of clinality and plumage variation in areas of potential contact have not been explored, vocalizations remain poorly documented, and mitochondrial DNA divergence is shallow (Andersen et al. 2018)."	
9487	259	"Taxon regalis (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Actenoides princeps (polytypic) based on available evidence. Restricted to montane forest, A. princeps sensu lato is readily separated from its lowland counterpart A. monachus based on combined mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data (Andersen et al. 2018). Despite this, the plumage of regalis is similar to that of immature monachus, suggesting that adult plumages of regalis are unknown. Furthermore, it is likely that additional taxonomic diversity is present within this complex (Rheindt et al. 2014); further research needed to better understand species limits."	
9522	261	"Taxon youngi (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Todiramphus veneratus based on similarities in vocalizations (Fry et al. 1992) and genetics (Andersen et al. 2015a, 2018; Thibault & Cibois 2017). The plumage of youngi is distinctive, albeit variable (van der Vliet et al. 2019), which may be indicative of gene flow with veneratus. Behavioral, bioacoustic, and genomic studies are needed to better understand species limits in this complex."	
9525	262	"Taxon gertrudae is treated as a subspecies of Todiramphus gambieri based on available evidence. Although restricted to widely allopatric populations within the Tuamotus, the taxa differ only in minor plumage characters. Limited mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data place gertrudae within the tutus complex of the Tuamotus, but DNA data for the unique type specimen of gambieri is lacking (Thibault & Cibois 2017); further genetic research is warranted."	
9532	260	"The Todiramphus chloris sensu lato complex is treated as six species based on genetics: T. chloris (polytypic); T. sordidus (polytypic); T. colonus (monotypic); T. sacer (polytypic); T. albicilla (polytypic); and T. tristrami (polytypic). Both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data (Andersen et al. 2015a, 2018; O’Connell et al. 2019) failed to recover T. chloris as monophyletic with the broadly sympatric T. sanctus, and other species, embedded within the complex. Although species limits remain poorly resolved, the groupings proposed by Andersen et al. (2015a, 2018) are mostly congruent with recognized biogeographical areas of endemism. Further research is needed to better define species limits in this highly polytypic complex."	
9633	267	"Taxon chalcocephala is treated as a subspecies of Galbula albirostris based on available evidence. Apart from crown and outer rectrix color, differences in plumage are minor (Haffer 1974), and there has been no formal analysis of vocalizations. Mitochondrial DNA data do not recover G. albirostris as monophyletic (Ferriera 2018), and relatively deep divergences occur amongst some clades (Naka et al. 2012; Ferriera et al. 2018). Limited genomic data also suggest that G. albirostris is paraphyletic, with G. cyanicollis embedded within it; further research needed."	
9668	269	"Taxon obamai is treated as a monotypic species separate from Nystalus striolatus (polytypic, including torridus) following Whitney et al. (2013). While the vocalizations of obamai are distinctive, diagnostic plumage and morphological characters are mostly lacking, and genetic data have produced conflicting results. Contra the preliminary mitochondrial DNA data of Whitney et al. (2013), broader geographic sampling (Duarte 2015) did not recover obamai or striolatus as monophyletic clades, and genomic data (Ferreira 2018) are limited. Furthermore, issues of data quality, small sample sizes, and mislabeling (e.g., Annex 1, Duarte 2015), indicate the need for a thorough genetic review of this complex."	
9675	270	"Taxon striatipectus (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Nystalus maculatus based on available evidence. Plumage differences (da Silva 1991) appear minor and inconsistent, a formal bioacoustic analysis is lacking, and divergence in mitochondrial DNA (Duarte 2015) and genomic data (Ferreira 2018) seems modest; further research needed."	
9721	272	"Taxon minor (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Malacoptila striata based on available evidence. Although differing in size, plumage characters are variable (Hellmayr 1929), vocal data are limited, and genetic divergences are comparable to other subspecific taxa in this genus (Ferreira et al. 2017; Ferreira 2018). Further research is required."	
9739	271	"Taxon bicinctus (polytypic, including stoicus) is treated as a species separate from Hypnelus ruficollis (polytypic) based on differences in plumage and vocalizations (Donegan et al. 2015). While hybridization appears limited, further research is needed to assess clinality and behavioral responses; genetic data are limited (Ferreira 2018)."	
9755	268	"Taxon subtectus (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Notharchus tectus (polytypic) based on available evidence. Differences in plumage appear minor and vocalizations are highly variable and poorly studied (Donegan et al. 2015), whereas mitochondrial DNA and genomic data are inconclusive (Ferreira 2018); further research warranted."	
9779	703	"Taxon cyanotis (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Psilopogon duvaucelii (polytypic) based on differences in plumage although vocalizations are similar, and genetic data are lacking; it is considered to be related to P. eximius (Boyce et al. 2019). A thorough review of this complex would be informative."	
9852	1230	"Taxa goffinii and purpuratus are placed in Trachylaemus, rather than Trachyphonus, based on differences in plumage and ecology, supported by divergence in mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Moyle 2004)."	
9853	675	"Taxon goffinii (polytypic, including togoensis) is treated as a species separate from Trachylaemus purpuratus based on plumage, facial bare parts color, and genetics. Deep mitochondrial DNA divergence (Moyle 2004) supports recognition of an eastern (purpuratus) and western clade but it is unclear if the western sample represented goffinii or togoensis. Pending further genetic research incorporating broader taxon sampling, togoensis is treated as a subspecies of T. goffinii."	
9870	674	"Trachyphonus darnaudii is treated as a single polytypic species based on available evidence. Taxa usambiro and emini sometimes treated as separate species but plumage and morphological differences are relatively modest. Furthermore, although usambiro is vocally distinct, and possibly allopatric, behavioral responses led Short & Horne (1985a) to recognize a single species in this complex. Mitochondrial DNA data are limited (Barker & Lanyon 2000; Moyle 2004; Brown et al. 2008) and a more thorough analysis of morphology, vocalizations and genetics would be informative."	
9875	680	"Taxon olivacea is placed in the monotypic genus Cryptolybia based on the mitochondrial-dominated DNA phylogeny of Moyle (2004), wherein Stactolaema was recovered as non-monophyletic, with olivacea a deeply diverged lineage."	
9883	676	"Cryptic taxon dowsetti is treated as a subspecies of Buccanodon duchaillui based on available evidence. Although known plumage differences are lacking, vocalizations of dowsetti are distinctive and it is separable based on mitochondrial DNA (Hall et al. 2021). The presence of multiple deep mitochondrial DNA divergences in this complex is suggestive of cryptic species; further research is needed."	
9887	679	"Taxon leucogrammica (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Stactolaema leucotis based on available evidence. Plumage differences are comparable to those between nominate leucotis and kilimensis and there is a lack of additional evidence (ecological or behavioral) for considering there to be more than a single species in this complex; however, genetic data would be informative given that the Uluguru Mountains are a known centre of endemism."	
9903	677	"Taxon cinereiceps (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Gymnobucco bonapartei, as the evidentiary basis for a split is weak. The distributions of bonapartei and cinereiceps appear to be continuous, with a cline of increasing size eastwards, and a broad hybrid zone. Although differences in iris color occur (Chapin 1939) there is no evidence of behavioral, ecological, or genetic differences to support species status."	
9908	678	"Taxon vernayi (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Gymnobucco calvus based on available evidence. Although plumages differ, the vocalizations of vernayi and congicus seem identical, and ecological differences have not been reported across what appears to be a fairly continuous distribution."	
9928	684	"Taxon makawai is treated as a synonym of Pogoniulus bilineatus based on analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA (Kirschel et al. 2018). Although plumage differences are striking, the single specimen of makawai is embedded within P. bilineatus suggesting that it is an aberrant color-morph; field observations have also failed to locate additional individuals of makawai (Dowsett et al. 2008)."	
9935	1194	"Taxon uropygialis (polytypic, including affinis) is treated as a species separate from Pogoniulus pusillus based on Kirschel et al. (2021)."	
9965	681	"The genus Pogonornis (polytypic) is recognized based on results of the mitochondrial-dominated DNA study of Moyle (2004), supported by differences in voice and sexual dimorphism between the Pogonornis group of species and those in Lybius (Short & Horne 1985a). As Tricholaema lachrymosa was found to be embedded within the Lybius-Pogonornis complex (Moyle 2004), a comprehensive genetic review incorporating broader taxon sampling and genomic or nuclear DNA loci is indicated."	
9967	682	Taxon macclounii (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Pogonornis minor based on phenotypic intermediacy across a broad hybrid zone (Short 1982b).	
9985	683	"The monotypic taxa leucogaster and senex are treated as subspecies of Lybius leucocephalus based on available evidence. Although sometimes split as separate species, plumage differences seem modest, ecologically the taxa are similar, and subspecies senex and albicauda are reported to interbreed (Short & Horne 1985a). Further evidence may show that the geographically isolated subspecies leucogaster warrants separation; further research needed."	
10005	274	"Taxon aurantiicollis (polytypic, including purusianus) is treated as conspecific with Eubucco richardsoni (polytypic) based on available evidence. Plumages are geographically variable, vocal differences have not been documented, and genetic data are lacking."	
10018	275	"Taxa steerii (monotypic) and glaucogularis (monotypic) are treated as conspecific with Eubucco versicolor based on available evidence. Although plumage differences appear pronounced, intermediates occur (Zimmer 1930), vocalizations of steerei and versicolor are indistinguishable, and genetic data are lacking."	
10033	276	"Taxon fitzpatricki is treated as a monotypic species separate from Capito wallacei (monotypic) based on differences in plumage and bill depth. However, mitochondrial DNA divergence (Seeholzer et al. 2012) is low, and vocalizations appear similar; further research required."	
10062	937	"Taxon cuvieri (polytypic, including inca) is treated as conspecific with Ramphastos tucanus, based on the presence of a broad zone of introgression between them (Haffer 1974), coupled with weak mitochondrial DNA differentiation and failure to recover the two taxa as monophyletic groups (Patané et al. 2009)."	
10070	1189	"Ramphastos vitellinus is treated as a single polytypic species based on available evidence. Sometimes split into 2 or 4 species based on differences in plumage, bill color, and iris color; however, vocal differences have not been properly documented, introgressive hybridisation appears to be extensive, and mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Patané et al. 2009) show evidence of mtDNA capture leading to paraphyly of taxon ariel. A recent genomic DNA analysis (Ostrow et al. 2023a) suggests there are five deeply diverged lineages within R. vitellinus; further research is desirable."	
10079	944	"Taxon humboldti is treated as a subspecies of Pteroglossus inscriptus based on available evidence. These taxa differ in size, minor plumage traits, and bill color patterns, and there is evidence that they hybridize along the Rio Madeira (Haffer 1974). Although mitochondrial DNA divergence is low (Patel et al. 2011; Ostrow et al. 2023a), divergence in genomic data (Ostrow et al. 2023a) is more pronounced; further research may support species recognition."	
10082	941	"Three species are recognized in the Collared/Fiery-billed Aracari complex (Pteroglossus torquatus/P. frantzii) based mostly on patterns of genetic divergence (Eberhard & Bermingham 2005; Patel et al. 2011) and extent of hybridization at contact zones (Haffer 1967, 1974; Ridgely & Greenfield 2001): polytypic Pteroglossus torquatus (including erythrozonus and nuchalis), which is the most distinctive taxon based on mitochondrial-dominated DNA data and forms a narrow hybrid zone with P. erythropygius sanguineus; monotypic P. frantzii that is parapatric, or narrowly sympatric, with P. torquatus without evidence of hybridization; and polytypic P. erythropygius, including sanguineus, as these taxa appear to form a narrow hybrid zone and exhibit minimal mtDNA divergence from each other. Further research based on nuclear or genomic data would be informative."	
10098	942	"Taxon mariae is treated as a subspecies of Pteroglossus azara, as the evidentiary basis for a split is weak. Members of this complex differ only in bill color, areas of apparent introgression have been reported for all taxon pairs (Haffer 1974), and mitochondrial-dominated DNA data suggest that mariae is sister to flavirostris, making azara paraphyletic (Patel et al. 2011). Further research would be informative."	
10102	N-60	"The original spelling beauharnaisii is here retained as correct. Much controversy has surrounded the use of a subsequent spelling ""beauharnaesii"", which—at times—was used more frequently than the original spelling. Disagreements over the correct application of beauharnaesii notwithstanding, usage proportions have shifted greatly since the argument unfolded. The continued use of the original spelling therefore seems well-advised."	
10103	943	"Taxon sturmii is treated as a subspecies of Pteroglossus bitorquatus based on available evidence. Reported to differ only in the colors of the iris and the bill, and photographic evidence suggests that these traits frequently do not assort in tandem, and divergence in mitochondrial-dominated DNA (Patel et al. 2011) is relatively weak. Further research in areas of contact may be informative."	
10108	938	"The seven taxa in the Aulacorhynchus prasinus complex are treated as conspecific based on available evidence. Sometimes split into three (e.g., Winker 2016) or four (Navarro-Sigüenza et al. 2001) species based on a combination of plumage and bill color differences; however, vocal differences have not been well-documented, and mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Puebla-Olivares et al. 2008; Bonaccorso et al. 2011) indicate relatively modest divergences consistent with subspecific differentiation in A. albivitta, and suggest that A. caeruleogularis would be paraphyletic (Puebla-Olivares et al. 2008) if it included cognatus as proposed by Winker (2016)."	
10116	939	"Taxa atrogularis (polytypic, including dimidiatus) and cyanolaemus are treated as conspecific with Aulacorhynchus albivitta pending further research. Sometimes split into 2 or 3 species based on plumage, bill color, and facial bare parts color. However, the proposed splits do not align with patterns of mitochondrial DNA divergence (Puebla-Olivares et al. 2008; Bonaccorso et al. 2011; Winker 2016), genetic data are lacking for some taxa, vocal differences remain poorly documented, and reports of hybridization and gene flow require more detailed study."	
10124	940	"Taxon calorhynchus is treated as a subspecies of Aulacorhynchus sulcatus based on weak mitochondrial DNA divergence (Bonaccorso et al. 2011), evidence of hybridization at geographically intermediate localities, and similarities in vocalizations (Schwartz 1972)."	
10151	945	"Taxon langsdorffii is treated as a subspecies of Selenidera reinwardtii based on available evidence. These taxa reportedly differ primarily in bill, iris, and facial skin coloration but some of these traits may be variable; localized hybridization is reported (Haffer 1974) but data are lacking from other regions of contact; and divergence in mitochondrial-dominated DNA is low (Lutz et al. 2013). Further research, especially across potential contact zones, would be informative."	
10187	273	"Taxon conirostris (polytypic, including ussheri) is treated as conspecific with Indicator minor based on the lack of clear-cut ecological, vocal, and plumage differences. Vocalizations appear to be indistinguishable (Short & Horne 1985b), reports of sympatric breeding (Friedmann 1969) have not been substantiated, and genetic data (Sonet et al. 2011) are uninformative; further research needed."	
10251	809	Taxon nigropunctatus is treated as a junior synonym of Picumnus squamulatus obsoletus based on the extensive plumage variation now known Rêgo et al. (2014).	
10281	808	"Taxon fulvescens is treated as a subspecies of Picumnus limae due to wide variation and clinality in plumage coloration, and lack of vocal differentiation (Lima et al. 2020). Sometimes synonymized with limae, continued recognition of fulvescens as a subspecies better accommodates the geographic extremes in plumage encountered between pale northern birds (limae) and richly colored southern birds (fulvescens); further research would be informative."	
10302	781	Taxon africana is placed in the monospecific genus Verreauxia based on deep divergence in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (Fuchs et al. 2006; Shakya et al. 2017) from the two Asian taxa retained in the genus Sasia.	
10318	782	"Taxon sordidus is treated as a subspecies of Hemicircus concretus based on available evidence. Although crest coloration of adult males differs notably between widespread sordidus and Javan concretus, other differences appear minor, and vocalizations are insufficiently known."	
10340	805	"Taxon grammithorax is treated as a species separate from Meiglyptes tristis based on plumage, but vocal and genetic evidence to support this split are lacking."	
10351	806	Taxon rafflesii is placed in the genus Gecinulus based on multilocus genetic (Shakya et al. 2017) and bioacoustic evidence.	
10399	786	"Taxon dedemi and polytypic guerini are treated as conspecific with Picus canus pending further research. Considerable phenotypic and vocal variation occurs within the P. canus sensu lato complex, with dedemi the most distinctive taxon. Multi-locus DNA data (Fuchs et al. 2008) are limited to the canus and guerini groups, which appear to introgress in northeastern China (Greenway 1940). Although splits may be warranted, further research, including a comprehensive genetic review, is needed to determine species limits in this complex."	
10435	785	"Taxon humii is treated as a subspecies of Chrysophlegma mentale based on available evidence. Although differences in plumage and proportions are present, vocal and genetic differences have not been confirmed; further research warranted."	
10438	807	"Taxa caroli and nivosus are placed in the genus Pardipicus based on genetic evidence. Formerly placed in Campethera, multilocus DNA data (Fuchs et al. 2006; Shakya et al. 2017) indicate a deep divergence between Pardipicus and Campethera sensu stricto. Recognition of Pardipicus also avoids the need to include the distinctive Geocolaptes olivaceus in Campethera to resolve paraphyly (Fuchs et al. 2006; Shakya et al. 2017)."	
10449	783	"Taxon taeniolaema (polytypic, including hausburgi) is treated as a species separate from Campethera tullbergi based on pronounced differences in underparts plumage, supported by divergence in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (Fuchs et al. 2017a). Vocalizations are poorly known and a formal bioacoustic analysis may be informative."	
10453	784	"Taxa permista and cailliautii (polytypic) are treated as conspecific with Campethera maculosa based on available evidence. Sometimes treated as two or three species based on plumage, taxon permista is only weakly differentiated from maculosa and hybridizes with the phenotypically distinctive cailliautii (Chapin 1952; Prigogine 1987). Divergence in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (Fuchs et al. 2017a) is modest, and vocalizations of all seem similar, suggesting they are best treated as conspecific pending further research."	
10478	804	"Taxa lineatus, pileatus, and schulzii are placed in Dryocopus based on available evidence. Sometimes separated in the genus Hylatomus based on putative paraphyly; however, mitochondrial DNA (Winkler et al. 2014) and multilocus data (Fuchs et al. 2006; Shakya et al. 2017) indicate a deep unresolved polytomy between Dryocopus, Mulleripicus, and species assigned to Hylatomus. Pending further research to determine generic limits, the more traditional two-genus arrangement, Dryocopus and the distinctive Mulleripicus, is adopted."	
10496	787	"Taxon fuscipennis is treated as a subspecies of Dryocopus lineatus based on minor plumage differences, apparent lack of vocal differences, and evidence of intergradation."	
10528	789	"Taxa occidentalis and tinnunculus are treated as subspecies of Celeus torquatus based on available evidence. Although phenotypic differences are present, intra-taxon variability in plumage and vocalizations, coupled with a poorly known hybrid zone between torquatus and occidentalis, indicates the need for further study, including genetics, before implementing any splits."	
10534	788	"Taxon grammicus (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Celeus undatus based on vocal, phenotypic, and genetic similarity assessed using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA (Benz & Robbins 2011; Sampaio et al. 2018). Furthermore, phenotypically defined subspecies groups could not be diagnosed genetically."	
10581	791	"Taxon aeruginosus is treated as a subspecies of Colaptes rubiginosus pending further research. The C. rubiginosus complex is paraphyletic with deep mitochondrial DNA divergences (Moore et al. 2011; Dufort 2016) indicating the presence of multiple species, but the phenotypically and vocally distinct aeruginosus has not yet been sampled. An integrative study of genetic, vocal, and phenotypic variation in this complex is needed before making any splits."	
10602	790	"Taxon atriceps is treated as a subspecies of Colaptes rivolii based on available evidence. Although plumage and vocal differences are present (Schulenberg et al. 2007), a putative hybrid zone of unknown width requires study before atriceps can be accepted as specifically distinct."	
10619	792	"Taxon melanolaimus is treated as a subspecies of Colaptes melanochloros pending further research. Although melanolaimus and melanochloros differ in plumage, shape, vocalizations, and ecology, there is evidence of extensive hybridization between them (Short 1971), discordance in the distribution of phenotypic and genomic variation, and shared mitochondrial DNA haplotypes (Kopuchian et al. 2020) in part of their range; a comprehensive genetic review is needed before implementing this split."	
10625	793	"Two species are recognized in the Colaptes auratus complex based on a combination of phenotypic, vocal (Wetmore 1941), and genetic evidence: polytypic C. auratus (including the cafer group of subspecies) and monotypic mexicanoides. Genomic data (Manthey et al. 2017) indicate that retaining C. mexicanoides in C. auratus renders the latter species paraphyletic. Additionally, evidence of hybridization between auratus and cafer over a broad zone (Short 1965) suggests that these are best treated as conspecific."	
10644	794	"Taxon cinereicapillus is treated as a subspecies of Colaptes rupicola based on available evidence. Plumages differ and vocal differences have been reported (Short 1982a), but a more comprehensive review of geographic patterns is needed to evaluate clinality and the extent of intergradation (Short 1972); genetic data would be informative."	
10648	795	"Taxon campestroides is treated as a subspecies of Colaptes campestris based on minor differences in plumage (apart from throat color), vocalizations, and mitochondrial DNA (van Els et al. 2021), and extensive hybridization over a broad zone (Short 1972)."	
10655	796	"Taxon splendens is treated as a species separate from Campephilus haematogaster based on differences in drumming (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001; Donegan et al. 2015), supported by multiple plumage differences, and higher call frequency. After voting by AviList, SACC considered and rejected this split, and hence the issue is likely to be reconsidered for a future version of AviList."	
10686	797	"Taxon validus is placed in the genus Chrysocolaptes based on genetics (Benz et al. 2006; Fuchs et al. 2006, 2017a; Winkler et al. 2014; Dufort 2016; Shakya et al. 2017), supported by phenotypic and vocal evidence. Sometimes placed in the monospecific genus Reinwardtipicus, but mitochondrial, nuclear, and combined DNA data show validus to be the sister lineage to Chrysocolaptes with a divergence time typical of basal splits within closely related genera."	
10689	837	"Taxon socialis is treated as a species separate from Chrysocolaptes guttacristatus based on obvious differences in vocalizations and drum roll (Rasmussen & Anderton 2012; Abhirami et al. 2021), supported by minor differences in plumage and size."	
10762	799	"Taxon santacruzi (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Melanerpes aurifrons based on genomic DNA evidence of monophyly and gene flow (Llanes-Quevedo et al. 2022). Sometimes treated as a separate species based on mitochondrial DNA data (García-Trejo et al. 2009) that placed nominate aurifrons as sister to M. carolinus, but Llanes-Quevedo et al. (2022) demonstrated that this is due to mtDNA artifacts. Further research is needed to determine species limits in this geographically variable complex."	
10784	802	"Taxon dorsalis (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Picoides tridactylus (polytypic) based on mitochondrial DNA and vocal differences (Winkler & Short 1978). As phenotypic variation is limited, a genome-wide DNA study is needed to affirm species limits in the dorsalis-tridactylus complex, including the status of funebris (here placed in tridactylus), which is sometimes treated as specifically distinct based on its darker plumage."	
10797	798b	"Genus Yungipicus (polytypic) is recognized based on genetics (Fuchs & Pons 2015; Shakya et al. 2017), supported by the relative morphological uniformity and diagnosability of this clade."	
10835	798d	Taxon mahrattensis is placed in Leiopicus based on multilocus DNA data (Shakya et al. 2017).	
10839	798c	"Taxa medius, dorae, and auriceps are placed in Dendrocoptes based on multilocus DNA data (Shakya et al. 2017)."	
10847	798a	"Chloropicus is restricted to three species based on multi-gene DNA data (Fuchs et al. 2017; Shakya et al. 2017), supported by morphology: C. namaquus; C. pyrrhogaster; and C. xantholophus."	
10879	800	"Taxon johnstoni (monotypic) is treated as conspecific with Dendropicos elliotii, as the evidentiary basis for a split is weak. Mitochondrial DNA divergence is limited (Fuchs et al. 2017a), and the presence of a phenotypically intermediate taxon, sometimes treated as valid subspecies kupeensis (Serle 1952), supports conspecificity."	
10911	801	"Taxon owstoni is treated as a subspecies of Dendrocopos leucotos based on genetics (Pons et al. 2021), supported by vocal similarities. Despite its large size and plumage distinctions, owstoni is deeply embedded within the Japanese clade of D. leucotos based on mitochondrial DNA data (Pons et al. 2021); genomic data would be informative."	
10961	798e	"Dryobates sensu lato is treated as three polytypic genera (Dryobates, Leuconotopicus, and Veniliornis) based on genetic evidence (Dufort 2016; Shakya et al. 2017). Multilocus DNA data indicate the presence of three divergent clades and their treatment as genera better accommodates the morphological disparity that would be encompassed within an expanded Dryobates."	
10976	803	"Taxon pernyii (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Dryobates cathpharius based on plumage differences, as well as apparent vocal differences and parapatry, but formal bioacoustic and genomic analyses are needed."	
11113	515	"Taxon cheriway is considered conspecific with Caracara plancus based on clinal variation in morphology, the presence of a broad zone of introgression between the two (Dove & Banks 1999), and very low levels of divergence at nuclear and mitochondrial DNA loci (Fuchs et al. 2012a)."	
11118	516	"Genetic data indicate that Milvago is not monophyletic (Fuchs et al. 2012a, 2015), with taxon chimango identified as the sister lineage to Phalcoboenus. Pending description of a new genus, chimango could be placed in Phalcoboenus or retained in Milvago. Alternatively, as here, chimango, the four species of Phalcoboenus, and M. chimachima, are folded into a single genus, Daptrius, consistent with evidence for a recent radiation in this group (Fuchs et al. 2015)."	
11145	517	Taxon insignis is transferred to the genus Neohierax based on morphology of the syrinx (Griffiths 1994) and a multi-gene dataset (Fuchs et al. 2015); both indicate that the traditional genus Polihierax is not monophyletic.	
11163	518	"Taxon rupicolus is split from Falco tinnunculus based on genetics (Groombridge et al. 2002; Fuchs et al. 2015) and plumage. Inclusion of rupicolus in F. tinnunculus renders that species polyphyletic based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (Fuchs et al. 2015). Taxon rupicolus also shows reduced sexual dichromatism compared to most subspecies, but additional genetic research is needed to resolve the status of other forms within the F. tinnunculus complex, particularly neglectus and alexandri."	
11238	514	"The African taxa ruficollis and horsbrughi sometimes are split from Asian nominate Falco chicquera (e.g., del Hoyo & Collar 2014) but the evidentiary basis for a split is considered weak. Differences in plumage are relatively minor and mitochondrial DNA data (Wink & Sauer-Gürth 2000, 2004) are more consistent with subspecies level divergence. Documentation of ecological differences and genomic data might add greater perspective to this proposed split."	
11281	N-69	"Some practitioners have used ""habroptila"" based on the fact that the gender of Strigops was established as feminine by Direction 26 of the ICZN in 1955, assuming that habroptila is an adjective. However, Greek coinages such as habroptilus/habroptila can variably be interpreted as nouns (""soft feather"") or adjectives (""soft-feathered""), with arguments in favor of either interpretation. In such cases, ICZN Article 31.2.2 stipulates their usage as a noun. Hence, Strigops habroptilus, the name that has had an overwhelming historic usage, is the correct epithet. We follow Savage and Digby (2023) in this decision."	
11300	644	The genus name Zanda is resurrected for the yellow-tailed and white-tailed cockatoos based on mitogenomic and genomic data (White et al. 2011; Provost et al. 2018; Smith et al. 2023).	
11323	645	"Taxon leadbeateri (polytypic) is placed in the genus Cacatua based on its relatively shallow genomic divergence from Cacatua (Smith et al. 2023), and recognition that its morphology and voice are fairly typical of the genus."	
11342	646	"Taxon citrinocristata is treated as a monotypic species separate from Cacatua sulphurea based on adult plumage (Collar & Marsden 2014), and difference in juvenile bill color (Schliebusch & Schliebusch 2001). Although C. sulphurea and C. citrinocristata were recovered as non-monophyletic based on analysis of a short mitochondrial DNA segment (Schliebusch & Schliebusch 2001), these results require verification."	
11357	643	"Taxon timneh is treated as a monotypic species separate from Psittacus erithacus (polytypic) based on plumage and genetics. Mitochondrial DNA (Melo & O'Ryan 2007) and genomic data (Smith et al. 2023) support separation of nominate P. timneh, but the placement of subspecies princeps is more controversial. Based on plumage birds on Príncipe align with erithacus, but mtDNA suggest that princeps is better placed with timneh (Melo & O'Ryan 2007). It is possible that both taxa now occur on Príncipe (with erithacus a recent arrival); further research needed."	
11426	631	"Taxon crassirostris is treated as a monotypic species separate from Forpus xanthopterygius based on nuclear, mitochondrial, and genomic DNA evidence (Smith et al. 2013, 2023) that F. xanthopterygius sensu lato is non-monophyletic with a relatively deep divergence."	
11444	624	"Myiopsitta luchsi (monotypic) is treated as a species separate from Myiopsitta monachus (polytypic). While mitochondrial DNA (Russello et al. 2008) and genomic data (Smith et al. 2023) suggest low divergence, there is not yet any evidence of hybridization despite their occurrence in parapatry. Myiopsitta luchsi differs significantly in plumage and morphometrics, and also exhibits striking differences in voice and its choice of natural cliffs as a nest substrate, while Myiopsitta monachus prefers trees or man-made substrates. Despite opportunities, there are no known examples that either one of them uses the other taxon's preferred nest substrate, suggesting they are indeed reproductively isolated."	
11516	626	"Taxon seniloides (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Pionus tumultuosus based on available evidence. Although seniloides differs in a number of plumage characters, and shows differentiation based on genomic (Smith et al. 2023) and mitochondrial DNA data (Ribas et al. 2007), a more thorough review of plumage variation, vocalizations, and genetics, including in areas of possible intergradation, is needed before implementing a split."	
11519	625	"Taxon reichenowi (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Pionus menstruus (polytypic) based on minor differences in plumage and bill color, coupled with shallow mitochondrial DNA divergence (Ribas et al. 2007)."	
11526	628	"Taxon bodini is treated as a subspecies of Amazona festiva based on available evidence. Plumages are variable, the potential for intergradation has not been thoroughly explored, and vocalizations have not been assessed. Genetic data are fragmentary (Russello & Amato 2004; Kirchman et al. 2012; Smith et al. 2023); further research needed."	
11534	627	"Taxa diadema and lilacina are treated as species separate from Amazona autumnalis based on available evidence. However, plumages in the A. autumnalis sensu lato complex are geographically variable, and genetic data are mostly incomplete and contradictory regarding relationships (Ottens-Wainright et al. 2004; Russello & Amato 2004; Pilgrim 2010; Smith et al. 2023); further research needed to determine species limits in this group."	
11547	629	"Taxon tresmariae (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Amazona oratrix based on available evidence. Sometimes treated as a separate species based on modest plumage and mitochondrial DNA divergence (Eberhard & Bermingham 2004; Russello & Amato 2004; Caparroz et al. 2009; Urantówka et al. 2014). Mitochondrial DNA data also recover A. oratrix sensu lato as non-monophyletic, but this has not been corroborated by available genomic data (Smith et al. 2023); further research with broader geographic and taxonomic sampling needed."	
11577	630	"Taxon guatemalae (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Amazona farinosa based on apparent intergradation in plumage characters across a broad contact zone and absence of consistent differentiation in vocalizations (Hellmich et al. 2021). Although a relatively deep mitochondrial DNA divergence separates farinosa and guatemalae (Wenner et al. 2012; Hellmich et al. 2021), genomic differentiation (Smith et al. 2023) is less pronounced; further research to assess the extent of gene flow between these taxa would be informative."	
11597	632	"Taxa xanthurus and xanthomerius are treated as subspecies of Pionites leucogaster based on variability in plumage traits that suggest intergradation. Furthermore, P. leucogaster is reported to intergrade with P. melanocephalus (Moncrieff et al. 2020) with available genomic data (Smith et al. 2023) indicating weak divergence between them; further research on the leucogaster-melanocephala complex is needed to determine species limits."	
11625	642	"The Pyrrhura picta complex is split into four species: P. picta (monotypic); P. emma (monotypic); P. subandina (polytypic, including eisenmanni); and P. caeruleiceps. Although this arrangement is supported by available genomic data (Smith et al. 2023), and although subandina and eisenmanni are likely sisters based on genomic data, further research is needed to determine whether eisenmanni also deserves species status. Unfortunately, subandina has not been reliably observed since 1949, which complicates comparative analyses with eisenmanni."	
11631	641	Taxon snethlageae (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Pyrrhura amazonum based on evidence of intergradation and failure of mitochondrial DNA to recover them as reciprocally monophyletic (Ribas et al. 2006).	
11636	633	"Taxa parvifrons (monotypic) and peruviana (polytypic) are treated as conspecific with Pyrrhura roseifrons pending further research. Plumage variation is incompletely documented (Joseph 2002) and relationships inferred from mitochondrial DNA data (Ribas et al. 2006; Arndt & Wink 2017; Morín Lagos 2021) have been inconsistent. Furthermore, genomic (Smith et al. 2023) and mitochondrial DNA data indicate that P. lucianii may be closely aligned to, or embedded within, this complex; a more comprehensive genetic review with broad taxon sampling is needed."	
11645	640	"The monotypic taxa chapmani and pacifica are treated as subspecies of Pyrrhura melanura based on available evidence. Multiple species may be involved but plumage variation within taxa, apparent paraphyly based on mitochondrial DNA (Ribas et al. 2006; Morin-Lagos 2021), and the complex relationships inferred therein, indicate that further research, including a comprehensive genetic review of the entire melanura-calliptera-albipectus complex, is needed."	
11718	634	"Taxon astec (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Eupsittula nana based on relatively minor differences in plumage and low mitochondrial DNA divergence (Latta et al. 2010). Furthermore, vocal analyses are lacking and differences in bill size may reflect local adaptation; further research would be informative given the unusual biogeographic pattern."	
11750	635	"Taxon acuticaudatus is placed in the monospecific genus Thectocercus following Remsen et al. (2013). Sometimes placed in Psittacara, but this relationship is not supported by mitochondrial DNA data (Urantówka et al. 2013)."	
11759	636	Taxon cumanensis (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Diopsittaca nobilis based on variability in the phenotypic characters considered diagnostic; further research needed.	
11768	638	"Taxon frontatus (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Psittacara wagleri based on consistent differences in plumage, morphometrics (Donegan et al. 2016), and habitat. Genetic data are fragmentary (Urantówka et al. 2013; Urantówka & Mackiewicz 2016; Smith et al. 2023) and no study has included both taxa."	
11779	639	"Taxon maugei (monotypic) is treated as a species separate from Psittacara chloropterus based on plumage, bill shape, and bill color, following Olson (2015a)."	
11782	637	"The monotypic taxa strenuus and brevipes are treated as species separate from Psittacara holochlorus (polytypic) pending further research. Available evidence regarding species limits in this complex are insufficient and conflicting, with no clear consensus among mitochondrial DNA datasets (Schweizer et al. 2014; Urantówka et al. 2014; Martínez-Gómez et al. 2017) or those from genomic DNA (Smith et al. 2023). Formal bioacoustic analyses and a comprehensive genetic review are needed before redefining species limits in this complex."	
11790	1174	"The Psittaculidae are recognized as a family separate from Psittacidae based on multilocus DNA (Joseph et al. 2012) and genomic data (Smith et al. 2023). However, the affinities of Coracopsis are poorly supported and it may also require recognition as a separate family."	
11797	647	Taxon sibilans is treated as a monotypic species separate from Coracopsis nigra based on moderate mitochondrial DNA divergence (Kundu et al. 2012; Jackson et al. 2016) and differences in size; further research would be informative.	
11876	648	"The Eclectus roratus complex is split into four species based on size, female plumage, and mitochondrial DNA data (Braun et al. 2017): E. roratus (polytypic, including vosmaeri and westermani); E. cornelia (monotypic); E. riedeli (monotypic); and E. polychloros (polytypic, including solomonensis and macgillivrayi as subspecies). These species groupings are also coincident with well-established biogeographic boundaries in the region."	
11907	649	Taxon hyacinthinus (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Geoffroyus heteroclitus based on minor differences in plumage and tail length; further research would be informative.	
11911	650	"Taxon abbotti is treated as a monotypic species separate from Psittinus cyanurus (polytypic) based on differences in size, bare parts color, and plumage. Minor vocal differences reported (Eaton et al. 2016) but these have not been formally analysed; genetic data would be informative."	
11916	N-37	"Mascarinus mascarin has also been used. Species-group name mascarinus is conserved as a justified emendation of punctuated original spelling, Psittacus mascarin. In ICZN Opinion 2455. Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature, vol. 77, pp. 62-77, 2020."	
11934	651	"Taxon everetti (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Tanygnathus sumatranus (polytypic) based on differences in plumage, iris color, and morphology, coupled with evidence of mitochondrial DNA divergence (Arndt et al. 2019)."	
11942	652	"A broad genus Psittacula sensu lato (including Lophopsittacus) is advocated for the present. However, this renders the genus paraphyletic based on mitochondrial DNA (Braun et al. 2016, 2019) and genomic data (Smith et al. 2023), with Tanygnathus embedded within it. Although mitochondrial DNA also placed Psittinus within Psittacula sensu lato, this relationship was not recovered using genomic data. A thorough assessment of the revisions proposed by Braun et al. (2016, 2019) is needed."	
11986	653	"Taxon lorentzi (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Psittacella picta based on available evidence. Plumage characters appear to form a stepped cline between eastern picta, central excelsa, and western lorentzi, a pattern suggestive of subspecies status; further research would be informative."	
12003	657	"Taxon flaviventris (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Pezoporus wallicus based on available evidence. Although mitochondrial DNA divergence is relatively deep (Joseph et al. 2011a; Murphy et al. 2011), phenotypic differences are slight, and corroborating information from ecology and behavior are lacking. Furthermore, support from nuclear DNA (Joseph et al. 2011) and genomic data (Smith et al. 2023) are interpreted cautiously due to limited taxon sampling and the potential for missing data to bias phylogenetic reconstructions (see Smith et al. 2023)."	
12035	656	"The Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae complex is provisionally split into three species to maintain consistency with regional taxonomies (Christidis & Boles 2008; Checklist Committee OSNZ 2022): C. saisseti; C. cookii (polytypic, including subflavescens); and C. novaezelandiae (polytypic, including cyanurus, chathamensis, and erythrotis). Additionally, taxon hochstetteri is treated as a subspecies of C. malherbi based on mitochondrial DNA data (Rawlence et al. 2015), although genomic data (Smith et al. 2023), morphology, and ecology suggest it may deserve species status, and this issue will be reconsidered for a future version of AviList. Despite numerous genetic studies, the taxonomy of this group remains unsettled, with evidence of recent divergence, past hybridization, and incomplete lineage sorting confounding delineation of species boundaries."	
12086	654	"Taxon narethae is treated as a monotypic species separate from Northiella haematogaster based on differences in plumage, and divergence in mitochondrial DNA with no signs of introgression (Dolman & Joseph 2015). Although limited genomic data also support the distinctiveness of narethae (Smith et al. 2023), broader geographic sampling is desirable."	
12093	655	"The genus Psephotellus is recognized for four species (P. varius, P. dissimilis, P. chrysopterygius, and P. pulcherrimus) based on the genomic data of Irestedt et al. (2019) and Smith et al. (2023). Previously placed in Psephotus along with haematonotus, genetic data shows this group to be non-monophyletic, with Northiella and Purpureicephalus embedded within it. Although all genera could be united in Psephotus, the morphological and ecological disparity present in this clade is best accommodated by the four-genus approach."	
12128	669	"Taxa camiguinensis and bonapartei are treated as monotypic species separate from Loriculus philippensis (polytypic) based on available evidence. Phenotypically, these are the most distinctive taxa in the philippensis complex (Arndt 2006; Tello et al. 2006; Allen 2020), differing in size and lack of sexual dimorphism (camiguinensis), and bare parts color (bonapartei). A comprehensive genetic and morphological review of the entire philippensis complex is needed, in which additional splits may be warranted."	
12157	N-72	"Suavipsitta Mathews, 1917 was an obsolete replacement name for a prior name, Nannopsittacus Mathews, 1916. Contra Mathews’ (1917) argument, Nannopsittacus is not a junior homonym of Nannopsittaca Ridgway, 1912 because of the Code’s one-letter rule (ICZN Article 57.6)."	
12158	667	"Nannopsittacus gulielmitertii is split into three species based on differences in plumage and size following Schnitker (2007): N. gulielmitertii (monotypic); N. nigrifrons (polytypic, including amabilis); and N. melanogenius (polytypic, including fuscifrons and suavissimus); genetic data would be informative."	
12167	668	"Taxon coxeni is treated as a subspecies of Cyclopsitta diophthalma based on available evidence. Although morphologically the most distinctive taxon in the group, mitochondrial DNA data (Mitchell et al. 2021) show it to be embedded within C. diophthalma. A comprehensive genomic and phenotypic review is needed to determine species limits in this complex, in which one or more splits may be warranted."	
12175	666	"Monotypic taxa godmani and cervicalis are treated as subspecies of Cyclopsitta desmarestii based on available evidence. Sometimes split into three species based on plumage traits, some of these exhibit a mosaic pattern occurring in populations at both ends of the geographic distribution; further research needed."	
12185	670	"A 12-genus arrangement is adopted for the Loriini based mostly on the genetic results of Joseph et al. (2020) and Smith et al. (2020, 2023). Although a 19-genus treatment of the Loriini has previously been adopted, this revised treatment is considered more informative given the recency of the radiation. The generic treatment adopted is: a monospecific Oreopsittacus, with O. arfaki; a monospecific Charminetta, with C. wilhelminae; a polytypic Hypocharmosina, with H. placentis and H. rubronotata; a polytypic Charmosynopsis, with C. pulchella and C. toxopei; a polytypic Charmosyna, with C. multistriata, C. josefinae, C. papou, and C. stellae; a polytypic Vini, with V. margarethae, V. rubrigularis, V. meeki, V. palmarum, V. amabilis, V. solitaria, V. ultramarina, V. stepheni, V. peruviana, and V. kuhlii; a polytypic Neopsittacus, with N. musschenbroekii and N. pullicauda; a polytypic Lorius, with L. garrulus, L. domicella, L. lory, L. hypoinochrous, L. albidinucha, and L. chlorocercus; a polytypic Psitteuteles, with P. versicolor, P. pusillus, and P. porphyrocephalus; a polytypic Chalcopsitta, with C. fuscata, C. cardinalis, C. duivenbodei, C. atra, and C. scintillata; a monospecific Glossoptilus, with G. goldiei; and a polytypic Trichoglossus, with T. johnstoniae, T. iris, T. flavoviridis, T. ornatus, T. reticulatus, T. borneus, T. semilarvatus, T. cyanogenius, T. histrio, and T. squamatus."	
12213	660	"Taxon stellae (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Charmosyna papou based on differences in plumage (Voisin & Voisin 1997; Beehler & Pratt 2016), supported by deep genomic DNA divergence and possible paraphyly (Smith et al. 2023)."	
12256	662	"The monotypic species pusilla and porphyrocephala are placed in the genus Parvipsitta based on the multilocus DNA data of Schweizer et al. (2015), and the genomic data of Smith et al. (2023). Previously included in Glossopsitta, phylogenetic studies did not recover the genus as monophyletic."	
12299	664	"Taxon rosenbergii is treated as a monotypic species separate from Trichoglossus haematodus (polytypic) based on plumage and genetics. Phenotypically, rosenbergii is one of the most distinctive members of the complex and is deeply diverged from nominate haematodus based on genomic DNA (Smith et al. 2020, 2023). However, rosenbergii shares mitochondrial DNA with subspecies massena and deplanchii of the T. haematodus sensu stricto complex (Braun et al. 2017); further research needed to clarify species limits across the entire T. haematodus sensu lato complex."	
12365	810	"Taxon harterti (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Eurylaimus javanicus based on available evidence. Sometimes treated as a separate species based on size, iris color, and minor plumage differences, but near-identical vocalizations suggest conspecificity; further research needed."	
12371	812	"Taxon affinis is treated as a subspecies of Cymbirhynchus macrorhynchos based on available evidence. Although differing in size and plumage, aspects of the distribution, ecology, and vocalizations of affinis remain elusive; further research needed."	
12377	811	"Taxon rubropygius is treated as a species separate from Serilophus lunatus based on plumage, wing structure, facial skin coloration and feathering, and narrow parapatry (Dekker & Dickinson 2000)."	
12418	881	"The Erythropitta erythrogaster complex is treated as 8 species based on a combination of morphological (Collar et al. 2015) and genetic evidence, mostly from mitochondrial DNA data (Irestedt et al. 2013). Six polytypic species are recognized: E. erythrogaster (including inspeculata, propinqua, yairocho, and thompsoni); E. celebensis (including caeruleitorques and palliceps); E. rufiventris (including cyanonota, bernsteini, and obiensis); E. rubrinucha (including piroensis); E. macklotii (including digglesi, oblita, loriae, finschii, and habenichti); and E. novaehibernicae (including gazellae, splendida, and extima), with the remaining two species being the monotypic E. dohertyi and E. meeki. Species delimitation in this complex remains open to change, and future additions of genomic and phenotypic datasets may lead to further splits or lumps."	
12437	1182	"Taxon habenichti is treated as a subspecies of Erythropitta macklotii pending further research. Sometimes considered a distinct species based on mitochondrial DNA divergence (Irestedt et al. 2013), but plumage differences are minor (although becoming more pronounced in mature male birds, complicating diagnosis), and habenichti intergrades with subspecies loriae. Further research using genomic DNA would be informative and may reveal the reason for incongruence in mtDNA and plumage traits in habenichti."	
12495	871	"Pitta sordida is split into 5 species based on a combination of genomic and bioacoustic data (Ericson et al. 2019): monotypic P. abbotti; monotypic P. forsteni; monotypic P. rosenbergii; polytypic P. sordida; and polytypic P. novaeguineae. Further splits may be warranted in the P. sordida group, as cucullata is genetically differentiated, despite similarities in song and plumage."	
12516	870	"Taxon morotaiensis is treated as a subspecies of Pitta maxima based on available evidence. Although vocal differences exist, bioacoustic variation in maxima is pronounced and approaches the call parameters of morotaiensis. Further research to document variability in plumage traits, and the addition of genomic data, would be informative."	
12519	869	"Taxa concinna and vigorsii are treated as species separate from Pitta elegans based on bioacoustic evidence, supplemented by plumage differences (Yue et al. 2020)."	
12554	335	"Taxon altera (polytypic, including heteroleuca) is split from Corapipo leucorrhoa based on differences in length of the outermost primary. Further research is required to determine if differences in primary structure are related to differences in display sounds, and whether these elicit species-specific responses. Genomic data (Harvey et al. 2020) show only modest divergence between altera and leucorrhoa."	
12559	1076	"Genus Antilophia is merged into genus Chiroxiphia following genomic evidence by Harvey et al. (2020), Leite et al. (2021), and Zhao et al. (2022), an arrangement also supported by multilocus DNA data (Silva et al. 2018)."	
12580	334	Taxon litae is split from Cryptopipo holochlora based on its distinctive vocalizations (Boesman 2016xx) and deep genomic divergence (Harvey et al. 2020).	
12587	851	"Taxon velutina (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Lepidothrix coronata based on vocalizations and genome-wide DNA data (Moncrieff et al. 2022), supplemented by plumage differences."	
12716	332	"Taxon squamipectus is retained as a subspecies of Pipreola frontalis based on reassessment of plumage and vocalizations. The taxa are narrowly allopatric and sometimes treated as separate species (del Hoyo & Collar 2016), but differences in plumage are inconsistent, at least for males, and vocalizations (Kirwan & Green 2011) have not been fully documented. Stronger evidence including genetic data are required to support a split."	
12748	333	"Taxon boliviana is retained as a subspecies of Phibalura flavirostris as the evidentiary basis for a split based on differences in plumage, bare parts color, and vocalizations (Hennessey 2011) is weak. Available genetic data are uninformative (Berv & Prum 2014), and further evidence based on ecological, behavioral, and genetic divergence between the two taxa is required."	
12827	834	"Taxon buckleyi (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Laniisoma elegans based on vocalizations (Boesman 2016c), genomic DNA data (Harvey et al. 2020), and differences in male and female plumages."	
12866	831	"Taxon braziliensis is treated as a subspecies of Tityra cayana based on vocalizations, evidence of intergradation where the two forms meet (Hellmayr 1929), and divergence in mitochondrial (Barber & Rice 2007) and genomic DNA (Musher et al. 2019) that is similar to subspecific differentiation within the closely related T. semifasciata."	
12876	839	"Tityra leucura is recognized as a valid species based on available evidence. Sometimes treated as a synonym of T. inquisitor, or considered to be of hybrid origin (inquisitor x albitorques), differences in plumage and bill size are more consistent with species status (Whittaker 2008). Genetic analysis of the type specimen would provide additional perspective on the species status of T. leucura. A recently photographed and videotaped individual summarized in SACC proposal #1035 strongly supports its specific status."	
12892	832	"Taxa xanthogenys (polytypic) and griseigularis are treated as conspecific with Pachyramphus viridis based on vocal similarity and genetics (Barber & Rice 2007; Musher & Cracraft 2018; Musher et al. 2019), supported by relatively minor plumage differences. Mitochondrial DNA data align griseigularis with xanthogenys (Musher & Cracraft 2018), rather than viridis as traditionally placed; further genomic and bioacoustic research on species limits would be informative."	
12925	836	"Taxon salvini is treated as a species separate from Pachyramphus albogriseus based on the integrative analysis of vocalizations, morphology, and genomic DNA data of Musher et al. (2023), with guayaquilensis treated as a synonym of P. salvini."	
12929	833	"Taxon uropygialis is treated as a subspecies of Pachyramphus major based on vocal similarity, genetics (Musher & Cracraft 2018; Musher et al. 2019, 2023), and variability in female plumage characters that had been considered diagnostic. Further research needed as nominate major has not been included in any genetic studies."	
12957	1178	"Oxyruncus is placed in the family Oxyruncidae based on genomic DNA evidence (Harvey et al. 2020). Sometimes subsumed into Tityridae, or recognized as a separate family that also includes Onychorhynchus, Myiobius, and Terenotriccus. However, recognition of Oxyruncidae is supported by the lack of a sister relationship with the Tityridae (Harvey et al. 2020), combined with the deep separation of Oxyruncus from Onychorhynchus, Myiobius, and Terenotriccus, and the lack of morphological or behavioral characters uniting them; the latter three genera are placed in the family Onychorhynchidae."	
12966	835	"Taxon swainsoni is treated as a species separate from Onychorhynchus coronatus based on consistent differences in vocalizations, plumage, and genetics (Harvey et al. 2020; Reyes et al. 2023). Although O. coronatus sensu lato is sometimes split into four species, vocal differences among coronatus, mexicanus, and occidentalis are weak, despite obvious differences in plumage and a relatively deep genomic divergence between coronatus and the mexicanus/occidentalis clade (Harvey et al. 2020); further research on species limits in this complex is warranted."	
13029	436	"Taxon albogularis is retained as a subspecies of Platyrinchus mystaceus as patterns of morphological, vocal, and genetic variation in this complex need further assessment. Based on available evidence (e.g., Remsen et al. 1991; Harvey et al. 2020), a two-species treatment may be inadequate."	
13085	439	"Taxon albidiventer is retained as a subspecies of Leptopogon superciliaris pending further research on species limits in this complex. Genomic data show albidiventer to be embedded within L. superciliaris (Harvey et al. 2020), but multiple species may be represented in this group. Vocal differences (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001; Schulenberg et al. 2007; Boesman 2016fff) also point to multiple species within the L. superciliaris complex. Further clarification of plumage distinctions, analysis of vocalizations, and broader genomic sampling is required."	
13096	438	"The polytypic Mionectes olivaceus complex is maintained as a single species pending further research. Despite genomic DNA evidence that M. olivaceus is paraphyletic (Harvey et al. 2020) there remains insufficient genetic and vocal data to accurately determine species limits in this complex. Until these issues are addressed, the decision to recognize a paraphyletic M. olivaceus was favored, as it minimises taxonomic instability."	
13115	447	"An expanded genus Pogonotriccus (polytypic, 9 species including difficilis and paulista) is separated from Phylloscartes based on genomic data (Harvey et al. 2020). Separation of Pogonotriccus is also supported by differences in plumages, behavior, and morphology."	
13156	843	"Taxon aequinoctialis (polytypic, and including the newly described taxon cryptus) is treated as a species separate from Rhynchocyclus olivaceus based on multilocus DNA evidence, supported by vocalizations (Simões et al. 2022), and apparent sympatry. Additional splits within R. olivaceus sensu stricto may be warranted (i.e., taxon guianensis)."	
13189	440	"Taxon flavotectus is treated as a monotypic species separate from Tolmomyias assimilis (polytypic) based on genetics and vocalizations. Genomic data (Harvey et al. 2020) did not recover T. assimilis sensu lato as monophyletic, instead placing flavotectus as sister to all other Tolmomyias. Vocal differences between flavotectus and forms retained in T. assimilis are striking."	
13203	446	Tolmomyias viridiceps and T. flaviventris are treated as separate species based on plumage and vocalizations. Songs differ markedly and plumages are consistently different across most of their range. Genetic studies based on genomic (Harvey et al. 2020) and mitochondrial DNA-dominated data (Almeida 2017) indicate low to moderate levels of divergence. The species occur in close proximity and may intergrade; further research in these areas required.	
13368	444	"Taxon bellicosa is retained as a subspecies of Hirundinea ferruginea, as comprehensive analyses of vocalizations, plumage, and genetics are lacking. Vocal differences between bellicosa and ferruginea seem diagnostic, but vocal structure is conserved. Plumages are variable but a comprehensive spatial analysis across all forms has not been conducted, and genomic data (Harvey et al. 2020) revealed modest divergence between these taxa, but was based on limited geographic sampling. Evidence supporting species status for bellicosa is quite strong but integrative studies are required."	
13382	445	"Taxon phoenicurus (polytypic, including aureiventris) is treated as conspecific with Myiotriccus ornatus based on available evidence. Plumage differences are not considered diagnostic and vocal differences are minor. Genomic data (Harvey et al. 2020) indicate moderate divergence, but only a single individual was sampled from each group; further genetic studies may be revealing."	
13405	449	"Taxon minimus is treated as a subspecies of Zimmerius chrysops (polytypic, including cumanensis) following Rheindt et al. (2013). Formal vocal analysis and more extensive genetic sampling are needed to better define species limits in this group."	
13409	448	"Taxon flavidifrons is treated as conspecific with Zimmerius viridiflavus following Rheindt et al. (2008a, 2013, 2014)."	
13418	443	"Taxon bahiae is split from Stigmatura napensis based on genetics. Genomic data (Harvey et al. 2020) did not recover S. napensis as monophyletic, instead aligning bahiae with S. budytoides. Vocalizations also differ between napensis and bahiae, although no quantitative comparisons have been made to other taxa in this complex. Further revisions are necessary, as S. budytoides (polytypic) and S. bahiae (monotypic) were not recovered as reciprocally monophyletic (Harvey et al. 2020)."	
13440	1198	"Acrochordopus (polytypic, including burmeisteri and zeledoni) and Tyranniscus (polytypic, including nigrocapillus, cinereiceps and uropygialis) are recognized as distinct genera based on genomic DNA evidence (Harvey et al. 2020) that Phyllomyias sensu lato is polyphyletic, supported by morphological and genomic differences that separate Acrochordopus from other species placed in Tyranniscus."	
13441	458	Taxon zeledoni (polytypic) is split from Acrochordopus burmeisteri (monotypic) based on genetics and vocalizations. Genomic data (Harvey et al. 2020) show a deep split between zeledoni (ssp. leucogenys) and burmeisteri; vocal analyses also support the existence of two groups (Parra-Hernández et al. 2020; Parra-Hernández & Arias-Moreno 2020). Further research on genetic and vocal differentiation within zeledoni is desirable.	
13484	456	"Myiopagis caniceps is split into three species based on genetics and vocalizations: M. caniceps; M. cinerea; and M. parambae. Genomic (Harvey et al. 2020) and mitochondrial DNA data (Rheindt et al. 2009b; Cuervo et al. 2014) both recovered M. caniceps sensu lato as paraphyletic with relatively deep divergences between all three taxa, and the vocalizations of all three taxa are distinct (Cuervo et al. 2014; Boesman 2016d)."	
13534	441	"Taxon chilensis is retained as a subspecies of Elaenia albiceps pending further research on species limits within the broader albiceps-pallatangae complex. Combined analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (Rheindt et al. 2009a; Chattopadhyay et al. 2017; Tang et al. 2018) indicate that albiceps and chilensis are not closely related, but also showed E. pallatangae to be embedded within chilensis despite obvious vocal differences. The current classification is unsatisfactory, but information needed for a thorough reassessment of species limits is lacking."	
13561	455	"Taxon cherriei is split from Elaenia fallax based on genetic and vocal data. Rheindt et al. (2008b) showed mitochondrial DNA divergences commensurate with species-level differentiation in Elaenia, and cursory vocal analyses indicate diagnosable calls and diurnal songs, although more detailed bioacoustic analyses are desirable."	
13592	457	"Taxon tumbezanus (polytypic, including inflavus) and maranonicus are treated as species separate from Nesotriccus murinus based on genomic DNA evidence (Zucker et al. 2016), supported by vocalizations. Previously placed in Phaeomyias, Zucker et al. (2016) recovered the distinctive insular N. ridgwayi as embedded within Phaeomyias, necessitating a change of genus name. Further splits may be warranted in the N. murinus group and uncertainty over the type locality of tumbezanus may have nomenclatural consequences that require resolution."	
13647	459	"Taxon munda is treated as a subspecies of Serpophaga subcristata based on genetics and vocalizations. Limited genomic (Harvey et al. 2020) and mitochondrial DNA data (Rheindt et al. 2008c) indicate that munda and subcristata are only recently diverged, with an absence of consistent vocal differences between them (Straneck 1993; Krabbe 2015; Pearman & Areta 2020)."	
13683	473	Taxon flammulatum is placed in the genus Ramphotrigon based on mitochondrial DNA (Lavinia et al. 2020) and genomic data (Harvey et al. 2020) that show it to be embedded within Ramphotrigon.	
13809	474	"Taxon lictor is placed in the monospecific genus Philohydor rather than in Pitangus based on genomic DNA data (Harvey et al. 2020), coupled with its distinctive syrinx and nesting behavior (see Lanyon 1984 for more attributes)."	
13846	466	"Taxon minor and taxon cinerascens are treated as subspecies of Myiodynastes hemichrysus based on vocalizations. Previously considered subspecies of M. chrysocephalus, their dawn and daytime songs are vocally almost identical to M. hemichrysus (Boesman 2016bbb)."	
13852	465	"Taxon solitarius is treated as a subspecies of Myiodynastes maculatus pending further research. Plumage, vocalizations, and migratory behavior of solitarius differ markedly from other taxa but thorough geographic sampling is needed to test for clinality. Possible hybrids with nominate maculatus have also been reported and merit further analysis (Zimmer 1937)."	
13882	464	"Taxon aurantioatrocristatus is treated as congeneric with Empidonomus varius based on similarities in morphology, behaviour, and vocalizations; genetic divergences are consistent with species-level relationships in closely related tyrannid genera (Tello et al. 2009; Harvey et al. 2020). Based on the combined evidence, the distinctive syringeal morphology of aurantioatrocristatus (Lanyon 1984) does not warrant its placement in a monotypic genus."	
13940	462	"Myiophobus fasciatus is split into three species based on consistent differences in plumages and vocalizations: M. fasciatus (polytypic); M. rufescens (monotypic); and M. crypterythrus (monotypic). Differences in vocalizations (Boesman 2016zz) are marked but no formal analyses have been undertaken, and reports of intergrades between crypterythrus and rufescens (Zimmer 1939; Koepcke 1961) seem questionable."	
13948	463	"The genus Ochthoeca is restricted to ten species (including salvini) based on genetic evidence (Tello et al. 2009; Harvey et al. 2020), with Silvicultrix used for frontalis, pulchella, diadema, and jelskii as proposed by Lanyon (1986), and Colorhamphus parvirostris retained as a monotypic genus. An earlier study based on short segments of mitochondrial DNA (García-Moreno et al. 1998) lacked sufficient resolution to be informative."	
13969	461	"Ochthoeca cinnamomeiventris is split into three species based on genetics, plumages, and vocalizations: O. cinnamomeiventris (monotypic); O. nigrita (monotypic); and O. thoracica (polytypic, including angustifasciata). Genomic data (Harvey et al. 2020) support recognition of three species; the split of thoracica is also supported by mitochondrial DNA (García-Moreno et al. 1998) and vocal data (Farnsworth & Langham 2020). Vocal data for nigrita is limited and further vocal studies are warranted."	
13982	460	"Taxon superciliosa (monotypic) is split from Ochthoeca fumicolor (polytypic) following Cory & Hellmayr (1927). Plumage differences between O. superciliosa and O. fumicolor are marked and vocal differences have been noted. However, formal analysis of vocalizations and genetic studies are needed."	
14002	N-31	"Guyramemua affinis has also been used. Guyramemua was declared neuter by the original describers, stipulating the use of affine."	
14031	467	"Two species are recognized in Pyrocephalus: P. nanus (polytypic, including dubius) and P. rubinus (polytypic) based on genetics and vocalizations. Variously considered to comprise 2, 3 or 4 species, mitochondrial DNA data (Carmi et al. 2016) recovered multiple clades, with a deep divergence separating the two Galapagos Island taxa (nanus and dubius) from all continental forms. Further research is needed to define species limits within P. rubinus sensu stricto, as preliminary genomic data (Harvey et al. 2020) conflict with some aspects of the mtDNA topology in Carmi et al. (2016); further revisions are likely, especially if a comprehensive review of vocalizations can be combined with more complete sampling at the genomic level."	
14108	922	"Taxon occidentalis is treated as a subspecies of Empidonax difficilis based on evidence of a broad region across which populations show intermediacy in plumages, vocalizations, and genomic DNA (Rush et al. 2009; Linck et al. 2019; Isacoff 2021; Hopping 2022)."	
14154	472	"Three species are recognized in the Contopus cinereus complex based on non-monophyly revealed by genomic DNA data (Harvey et al. 2020), supported by plumage and vocalizations: C. cinereus (polytypic, including pallescens); C. bogotensis (polytypic, including surinamensis, brachytarsus, rhizophorus, and aithalodes); and monotypic C. punensis. A more comprehensive genetic review with dense taxon sampling is in progress and may shed additional light on species limits in this complex."	
14188	471	"Genus-level changes in the fluvicoline tyrant flycatchers are based on a combination of genetic (summarised by Chesser et al. 2020b; Ohlson et al. 2020), phenotypic, and behavioral data. The classification recognizes: Syrtidicola fluviatilis based on deep genetic divergence from Muscisaxicola (Chesser et al. 2020b), as well as morphological and ecological differences; Cnemarchus rufipennis based on common themes in plumage, vocalizations and ecology with C. erythropygius; Pyrope pyrope based on deep genetic divergence within the Xolmis sensu lato clade (Chesser et al. 2020b; Ohlson et al. 2020); monospecific Nengetus (N. cinereus) based on deep genetic divergence, and its distinctive plumage and ecology; Neoxolmis restricted to four species (N. rufiventris, N. rubetra, N. salinarum, and N. coronatus) which form a cohesive group based on plumage and ecology to the exclusion of cinereus; Xolmis restricted to X. irupero and X. velatus based on genetics; and Heteroxolmis dominicanus, as genetic data show it to be outside the Xolmiini and sister to Alectrurus (Chesser et al. 2020b; Ohlson et al. 2020) a placement also supported by osteological characters."	
14204	470	"Taxon occipitalis is treated as a subspecies of Muscisaxicola rufivertex based on available evidence. Mitochondrial DNA divergence (Chesser 2000) is consistent with subspecific level, and plumage traits have not been assessed for clinal variation; further research needed."	
14227	468	"Taxon sclateri (monotypic) is treated as conspecific with Knipolegus orenocensis (polytypic, including xinguensis) pending further research. Comparative vocal and genetic data from across the entire range of orenocensis are needed."	
14247	469	"Taxon heterogyna is treated as a subspecies of Knipolegus aterrimus based on available evidence. Sometimes treated as a separate species based on plumage and vocalizations, but vocal data are sparse and a formal bioacoustic analysis is lacking. Phylogenetic placement of heterogyna as sister to K. signatus appears to be based on misidentification of the heterogyna sample in the genomic DNA study of Harvey et al. (2020); further research needed."	
14308	541	Taxon bitorquata is treated as a subspecies of Melanopareia torquata based on the absence of clear differences in vocalizations and morphology in this complex.	
14335	239	"Taxon snethlageae (polytypic, including pallida) is treated as a species separate from Conopophaga aurita (polytypic) based on vocalizations (Whitney 2003, Boesman 2016hh), and divergence in mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Batalha-Filho et al. 2014)."	
14359	827	Taxon stictoptera is treated as a subspecies of Myrmornis torquata based on available evidence. Vocal differences are small and vary within taxa (Boesman 2016gg) and plumage differences are minor. Modest genomic divergence (Harvey et al. 2020) and an unusual distributional pattern indicate that further research may be warranted.	
14369	828	"Taxa aequatorialis and gularis are treated as subspecies of Thamnistes anabatinus pending further research. Both taxa are sometimes placed in a polytypic T. aequatorialis, along with the vocally distinct rufescens. While vocalizations (Isler & Whitney 2017), size, apparent parapatry, and mitochondrial DNA data (Weir 2009) are suggestive of species-level divergence for aequatorialis, genetic data for gularis and rufescens are lacking; further research is needed to determine taxonomic affinities across the entire complex."	
14439	814	"Taxon hoffmannsi is treated as a subspecies of Epinecrophylla ornata based on available evidence. Sometimes treated as a separate species, mitochondrial DNA and genomic data (Johnson et al. 2021) indicate that splitting hoffmannsi would create a paraphyletic E. ornata. Furthermore, while vocalizations of hoffmannsi are distinctive (Boesman 2016cc), they are incompletely differentiated from other subspecies. A comprehensive study of vocal, genetic, and morphological data is needed to determine species limits in this complex."	
14470	818	"Taxon luctuosa is treated as a subspecies of Myrmotherula axillaris based on available evidence. Although vocally distinct, genomic DNA data (Harvey et al. 2020) indicate that splitting luctuosa would render M. axillaris as paraphyletic. As multiple species may be present in this complex, an integrated review of vocalizations, morphology, and genetics is needed to determine species limits."	
14497	819	"Myrmotherula fluminensis is recognized as a monotypic species based on the genomic DNA data of Harvey et al. (2020). Sometimes regarded as a hybrid (M. unicolor x M. axillaris luctuosa), or an aberrant form of luctuosa based on plumage and vocalizations (Mallet-Rodrigues 2008); genetic data, however, recovered fluminensis as a deeply diverged lineage and sister to Formicivora iheringi (Harvey et al. 2020). Further research needed to confirm generic placement and reassess vocalizations."	
14518	815	"Taxon intermedia (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Formicivora grisea based on substantial vocal differences (Hilty 2003; Boesman 2016dd), and deep divergence in genomic DNA data (Harvey et al. 2020), supported by differences in female plumage."	
14528	816	"Taxon littoralis is treated as a subspecies of Formicivora serrana based on similarity in vocalizations, clinality in plumage characters (Firme & Raposo 2011), and limited genomic divergence (Harvey et al. 2020)."	
14540	817	"Taxon paludicola is treated as a subspecies of Formicivora acutirostris based on minor differences in plumage, vocalizations, and mitochondrial DNA (Buzzetti et al. 2013)."	
14607	822	"Taxon fulva is treated as a species separate from Frederickena unduliger based primarily on vocal differences (Isler et al. 2009), supported by multilocus DNA (Bravo 2012) and genomic data (Harvey et al. 2020). However, the differences in female plumage noted for fulva (Zimmer 1944) may not be diagnostic; further research needed."	
14612	1224	"Taxon cristatus is placed in the monotypic genus Sakesphoroides, rather than in Sakesphorus, based on genomic DNA evidence of non-monophyly (Harvey et al. 2020; Bravo et al. 2021), supported by morphological divergence (Grantsau 2010)."	
14618	1225	"Taxon sellowi is placed in the monotypic genus Radinopsyche, rather than in Herpsilochmus, based on genomic DNA evidence of non-monophyly (Harvey et al. 2020; Bravo et al. 2021), supported by divergence in morphology and vocalizations."	
14673	830	"Southern populations of Herpsilochmus scapularis (type locality Bahia), are treated as a synonym of H. rufimarginatus based on morphology and vocalizations (da Silva 2013; Boesman 2016ee), a treatment also supported by genetic data (Bravo et al. 2021). Populations to the north of the Sao Francisco river, sometimes designated as scapularis, are placed in nominate H. frater but may warrant subspecific recognition; further research needed."	
14678	820	"Taxon pulchellus is treated as a species separate from Sakesphorus canadensis based on differences in vocalizations (Boesman 2016ff), genomic DNA (Harvey et al. 2020), and plumage. Nevertheless, a formal bioacoustic analysis and broader genetic sampling would be informative. Subsequent to the vote to split pulchellus, this split was considered by and rejected by SACC, and hence is likely to be reconsidered for a future version of AviList."	
14700	823	"Taxon subfasciatus (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Thamnophilus ruficapillus pending further research. Genomic data (Harvey et al. 2020) indicate that the T. ruficapillus complex is paraphyletic, but subspecies subfasciatus has not been sampled. Broader genetic sampling and formal bioacoustic analyses will be needed to better define species limits in this complex."	
14724	821	"Taxon shumbae is treated as a species separate from Thamnophilus bernardi based on differences in vocalizations (Schulenberg et al. 2007) and plumage. Formal bioacoustic analyses and genetic data would be informative. Subsequent to the vote to split shumbae, this split was considered by and rejected by SACC, and hence is likely to be reconsidered for a future version of AviList."	
14806	824	"Taxon nigrigula is treated as a subspecies of Willisornis vidua based on minor differences in vocalizations (Isler & Whitney 2011), limited divergence in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA (Quaresma et al. 2022), and a lack of concordance between genetic patterns and recognized subspecies boundaries; further research needed."	
14929	825	"Taxon maculifer (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Poliocrania exsul based on the lack of consistent vocal differences (Woltmann et al. 2020), and the presence of birds of intermediate plumage in a contact zone between the two taxa (Wetmore 1962; Ridgely & Gwynne 1989)."	
15022	829	Taxa similis (monotypic) and maura (polytypic) are treated as species separate from Pyriglena leuconota based on vocal and genetic differences (Isler & Maldonado-Coelho 2017). Mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Isler & Maldonado-Coelho 2017) identified three clades within P. leuconota sensu lato that are as distinctive as other recognized species in this complex. A more comprehensive review of genetics and vocalizations in this complex would be informative.	
15042	826	"Akletos and Hafferia are recognized as genera separate from Percnostola pending further research. Phylogenetic relationships among these and closely related genera (Gymnocichla and Pyriglena) are uncertain, and differ between genomic (Harvey et al. 2020) and multilocus DNA (Bravo 2012; Isler et al. 2013) datasets. To avoid creating paraphyletic groups if taxa were subsumed into larger genera, it is preferable to maintain the genera Akletos, Hafferia, and Percnostola, pursuant to a thorough review of generic limits in this part of the thamnophilid tree."	
15063	748	"Taxa fulviventris, berlepschi, and dives are placed in the genus Myrmothera, and nattereri is placed in the newly described genus Cryptopezus based on genetic evidence from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA (Carneiro et al. 2019) that the traditional genus Hylopezus is paraphyletic."	
15103	745	"Three species are recognized in the Hylopezus macularius sensu lato complex based on the mitochondrial DNA and vocal differences outlined by Carneiro et al. (2012), with additional support from genomic data (Harvey et al. 2020): H. macularius (including dilutus); H. whittakeri; and H. paraensis. Although phenotypic and genetic divergence across this complex is modest, the newly described Hylopezus whittakeri is distinct vocally and was recovered as sister to paraensis (Carneiro et al. 2012; Harvey et al. 2020); thus, paraensis is also split to avoid creating a paraphyletic H. macularius."	
15121	746	"Taxon subcanescens is treated as a monotypic species separate from Myrmothera campanisona based on vocalizations (Krabbe & Schulenberg 2003; Boesman 2016hhh) and genetics (Carneiro et al. 2018). Although phenotypic differences are slight, vocal differences are marked, and subcanescens is recovered as sister to M. simplex based on mitochondrial DNA and multilocus data (Carneiro et al. 2018)."	
15205	744	"A revision of the Grallaria rufula complex is adopted based on the comprehensive reviews of Chesser et al. (2020a) and Isler et al. (2020) integrating genetic, vocal, and plumage characters. This includes recognition of Grallaria rufocinerea as a member of this complex; elevating taxa spatiator, saltuensis, saturata, occabambae (including a newly described subspecies, marcapatensis), cochabambae, cajamarcae, rufula, and obscura to species rank; and the recognition of six monotypic species that are newly described: G. alvarezi; G. gravesi; G. oneilli; G. centralis; G. ayacuchensis; and G. sinaensis."	
15223	747	"The Grallaria quitensis sensu lato complex is treated as three monotypic species based on differences in vocalizations, supported by modest plumage differences (Krabbe & Schulenberg 2003; Boesman 2016ii): G. alticola; G. atuensis; and G. quitensis. While mitochondrial DNA and genomic data (Winger et al. 2015) support recognition of G. alticola, taxon atuensis was not included in the analysis."	
15226	397	"The name Grallaria urraoensis is adopted for the Urrao Antpitta, as the type material of G. fenwickorum is considered inadequate. The photos of G. fenwickorum that form part of the type material are not comprehensive in showing the features of the species, and can be readily altered, and the feathers were not lodged in an organized natural history collection (Peterson 2013), such that their ultimate fate is subject to question."	
15397	724	"Taxon obscurior (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Sclerurus mexicanus (polytypic, including pullus) based on deep divergence in mitochondrial DNA (d’Horta et al. 2013), paraphyly with S. rufigularis based on genomic data (Harvey et al. 2020), and vocal differences (Boesman 2016kk; Cooper & Cuervo 2017). Further research is needed to determine species limits in the S. mexicanus sensu stricto complex."	
15430	725	"Taxon cearensis is treated as a subspecies of Sclerurus scansor based on available evidence. Sometimes recognized as a separate species based on plumage and vocalizations; however, patterns of mitochondrial DNA divergence (d'Horta et al. 2011, 2013) are more consistent with subspecies-level differentiation in the genus Sclerurus, and variability in vocalizations (Boesman 2016ll) requires further documentation."	
15488	716	"Taxon griseus (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Sittasomus griseicapillus pending further research. This variable complex is sometimes split into eastern (S. griseicapillus) and western (S. griseus) groups based on plumage and vocalizations. However, genomic data (Harvey et al. 2020) indicate that the griseus group is embedded within the griseicapillus group, suggesting that Sittasomus likely consists of more than two species. As not all taxa have been sampled genetically, we continue to recognize only a single species pending completion of a comprehensive genetic, vocal, and phenotypic review of the complex."	
15505	715	"Three species are recognized in the Deconychura longicauda complex based on a combination of mitochondrial DNA (Barbosa 2010) and vocal (Boesman 2016mm) evidence: polytypic D. typica (typica, darienensis, and minor); nominate D. longicauda (monotypic); and polytypic D. pallida (pallida, connectens, and zimmeri). Both vocal and mtDNA data indicate the presence of an unnamed taxon in the Andean foothills (Barbosa 2010; Boesman 2016mm; see also Schulenberg et al. 2010) that probably represents a fourth species; formal nomenclatural description of this taxon is underway."	
15547	717	"Taxon taunayi is treated as a subspecies of Dendrocincla turdina based on genetics, supported by vocalizations. More commonly treated as a subspecies of Dendrocincla fuliginosa, however, mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Weir & Price 2011; Schultz et al. 2019) place taunayi as sister to D. turdina. Vocalizations also align taunayi with D. turdina (Weir & Price 2011) but formal bioacoustic analyses are lacking; further research may support species recognition for taunayi."	
15559	718	"Taxon punctipectus is treated as a subspecies of Dendrocolaptes sanctithomae based on available evidence. Sometimes split from D. sanctithomae as a monotypic species based on vocal differences (Boesman 2016nn) and plumage characters, but the possibility of hybridization in areas of contact (Marantz 1997) and lack of formal bioacoustic and genetic analyses suggest that punctipectus is best treated as conspecific with D. sanctithomae pending further research."	
15592	726	"Taxon uniformis (polytypic, including brigidai) is treated as a species separate from Hylexetastes perrotii based on genetic evidence (Azuaje-Rodríguez et al. 2020; Harvey et al. 2020). Sometimes treated as one, two, or three species, vocalizations are apparently similar across the group, and plumage differences subtle. However, mitochondrial-dominated (Azuaje-Rodríguez et al. 2020) and genome-wide DNA data (Harvey et al. 2020) place perrotti as sister to H. stresemanni, rather than uniformis or brigidai, which are only weakly diverged from each other."	
15647	727	"The widespread, polytypic Xiphorhynchus ocellatus complex is treated as a single species pending further research. Although mitochondrial and multilocus DNA data (Aleixo 2002; Sousa-Neves et al. 2013; Harvey et al. 2020) indicate deep divergences within the complex there is considerable conflict among datasets regarding phylogenetic relationships, in particular with respect to the related species X. pardalotus. Vocalizations also vary across the complex (Marantz et al. 2003; Schulenberg et al. 2010), but there is no rigorous survey of vocal variation within and between clades. Splits within the complex seem likely, but it is premature to recognize more than a single species."	
15671	728	"Taxon guttatoides (polytypic, including dorbignyanus) is treated as conspecific with Xiphorhynchus guttatus pending further research. Xiphorhynchus guttatus forms a complex with X. susurrans (polytypic) and the two groups have previously been treated as conspecific. Mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Aleixo 2002; Rocha et al. 2015) recovered X. susurrans as embedded within the X. guttatus complex, and identified deep divergences suggestive of species-level differences; however, populations of the guttatus group were separated geographically by the guttatoides group, creating a leapfrog distribution pattern. Given this complexity, we refrain from splitting guttatoides pending availability of genomic data and a comprehensive analysis of vocalizations that includes X. susurrans."	
15693	719	"Taxon aequatorialis (polytypic, including punctigula and insolitus) is treated as conspecific with Xiphorhynchus erythropygius pending further research. Sometimes split as a separate species based on vocal (Boesman 2016oo) and plumage differences; however, vocalizations are variable within taxa and formal bioacoustic and playback experiments are lacking. Furthermore, Johnson & Mason (2022) suggested that there may be three vocal groups in the complex; further research needed to determine species limits."	
15735	729	"Three species are recognized in the Campylorhamphus procurvoides complex based on deep genetic divergences, as assessed by mitochondrial and genomic DNA (Aleixo et al. 2013; Portes et al. 2013; Harvey et al. 2020), supported by vocalizations (Boesman 2016pp): a polytypic C. procurvoides (including sanus and gyldenstolpei); a polytypic C. probatus (including cardosoi); and a monotypic C. multostriatus. In addition, C. trochilirostris is paraphyletic with respect to C. procurvoides (Harvey et al. 2020), suggesting further splits in trochilirostris may be warranted, pending a more comprehensive genomic and vocal analysis."	
15774	720	"Taxon neglectus is treated as a subspecies of Lepidocolaptes affinis pending further research. Although neglectus is the most genetically divergent member of this complex (Arbeláez-Cortés et al. 2010, 2012), and also differs vocally from lignicida and affinis (Boesman 2016y), the observed mitochondrial DNA divergence is relatively shallow, and the reported vocal differences require more rigorous documentation."	
15803	1228	"Taxon mexicanus is treated as a polytypic species separate from Xenops genibarbis based on differences in vocalizations (Boesman 2016qq) and behavior (Freeman & Montgomery 2017), supported by genomic DNA divergence (Harvey & Brumfield 2015)."	
15809	"721a, 1228"	"721a)) Monotypic Xenops minutus of the Atlantic Forest is split from a polytypic Xenops genibarbis following del Hoyo & Collar (2016) and based on differences in plumage, vocalizations (Boesman 2016qq), and genetic divergence (Harvey & Brumfield 2015). 1228)) Taxon mexicanus is treated as a monotypic species separate from Xenops genibarbis based on differences in vocalizations (Boesman 2016qq) and behavior (Freeman & Montgomery 2017), supported by genomic DNA divergence (Harvey & Brumfield 2015)."	
15813	721b	"Genetic evidence suggests that the northernmost taxon of the Atlantic Forest region, alagoanus, is synonymized with Xenops genibarbis genibarbis (Burney 2009), but this is based on mitochondrial DNA data, and should be confirmed with data from nuclear genes."	
15815	721a	"Monotypic Xenops minutus of the Atlantic Forest is split from a polytypic Xenops genibarbis based on differences in plumage, vocalizations (Boesman 2016qq), and genetic divergence (Harvey & Brumfield 2015)."	
15816	N-34	"Xenops rutilus has also been used. X. rutilans is in overwhelming prevailing usage and therefore protected by Article 33.3.1 from arguments about a potentially older spelling. The availability of rutilus is additionally questionable in view of its original publication in a plate wrapper, not as part of the original text."	
15845	735	"Taxon pariae is treated as a subspecies of Premnoplex tatei based on available evidence. Sometimes split based on differences in plumage and vocalizations (Boesman 2016uu); however, vocal material is limited, and mitochondrial DNA divergence modest (Pérez-Emán et al. 2010). Further research including a comprehensive bioacoustic analysis and genetic data would be informative."	
15867	732	"Taxon holti is treated as a subspecies of Cichlocolaptes leucophrus based on available evidence. Sometimes split based on differences in plumage, size, and vocalizations (Mazar Barnett & Buzzetti 2014), the reported differences seem minor, and possible clinality in these traits has not been assessed."	
15874	1227	"Taxa erythrocercum and fuscipenne are placed in the newly described genus Neophilydor following Sangster et al. (2023). Formerly placed in Philydor, but mitochondrial-dominated and genomic DNA data (Derryberry et al. 2011; Harvey et al. 2020) recover the genus as polyphyletic, with the clade comprising erythrocercum and fuscipenne being more closely related to Anabazenops (Harvey et al. 2020) or Megaxenops (Derryberry et al. 2011)."	
15938	733	"The genus Dendroma is recognized for D. rufa and D. erythroptera based on genetic evidence. Formerly placed in Philydor, mitochondrial DNA (Derryberry et al. 2011) and genomic data (Harvey et al. 2020) do not recover the genus as monophyletic, with taxa rufa and erythroptera deeply diverged from core Philydor and sister to Ancistrops."	
15997	734	"The Automolus ochrolaemus complex is treated as three species based on genetics, supported by vocalizations: monotypic A. exsertus; polytypic A. cervinigularis (including hypophaeus); and polytypic A. ochrolaemus (all other subspecies). Although A. exsertus has sometimes been recognized based on vocal discrimination experiments with allopatric hypophaeus (Freeman & Montgomery 2017), a comprehensive analysis of vocalizations in this complex is lacking. Mitochondrial DNA data (Smith et al. 2014) recovered exsertus as a deeply diverged sister lineage to a clade composed of other Middle American taxa (cervinigularis and hypophaeus), and both are deeply diverged from other members of the A. ochrolaemus complex, supporting a three-way split."	
16006	723	"Taxon virgatus (polytypic, including nicaraguae, assimilis, and cordobae) is treated as a species separate from Automolus subulatus based on differences in vocalizations (Boesman 2016tt), supported by differences in plumage, divergence in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA (Claramunt et al. 2013; Schultz et al. 2017; Harvey et al. 2020), and evidence of song discrimination (Freeman & Montgomery 2017)."	
16035	722	"Taxon johnsoni is treated as a monotypic species separate from Pseudocolaptes lawrencii based on genetics, supported by plumage and vocalizations. Analyses based on mitochondrial-dominated DNA (Forcina et al. 2021) and genome-wide data (Harvey et al. 2020) indicate that P. johnsoni forms an unresolved polytomy with P. boissonneautii and P. lawrencii, while vocal differences (Boesman 2016rr), together with some evidence of song discrimination (Freeman & Montgomery 2017) provide additional support for this split."	
16037	N-35	"Pseudocolaptes boissonneauii has also been used. The spelling boissonneautii is the original spelling, and there is no reason to invoke that this was an inadvertent error. The additional letter T may either stem from a Latinization of the name Boissonneau into Boissonneautius, or it may reflect the frequent French usage of T as a sliding consonant between two vowels. The original author was French and should be granted the right to form the name as he pleased."	
16066	730	"Three species are recognized in the Furnarius leucopus complex based on a combination of vocalizations, morphology (including plumage and iris color), supported, in part, by genetic data: polytypic F. leucopus; monotypic F. cinnamomeus; and polytypic F. longirostris (including endoecus). Genomic data (Harvey et al. 2020) indicate that the Furnarius leucopus sensu lato complex is paraphyletic with respect to F. torridus, supporting the split of cinnamomeus, however, this study did not include samples of longirostris/endoecus. Evidence of genetic and vocal divergence within the polytypic leucopus sensu stricto clade (Boesman 2016ss; Harvey et al. 2020) suggest that further splits may be warranted."	
16103	731	"Taxon maculirostris is treated as a subspecies of Cinclodes antarcticus based on available evidence. Sometimes split based on differences in plumage, soft part colors, and relative proportions; however, genetic differentiation between the taxa, as assessed by mitochondrial DNA (Campagna et al. 2012) and genomic data (Harvey et al. 2020), seems to be low, vocal differences have not been documented, and there is evidence of phenotypic intermediacy in some traits; further research required."	
16136	N-32	"Aphrastura masafucrae has also been used. The name masafuerae should be applied for two reasons: (1) ICZN Code Article 33.3.1 must be heeded. At the time of this assessment, a Google search showed only 158 internet usages for masafucrae but 2360 for masafuerae (this excludes usages for non-avian organisms named ""masafuerae""), which amounts to more than an order of magnitude of a difference in usages. (2) Article 32.5.1 stipulates the following: ""…If there is in the original publication itself, without recourse to any external source of information, clear evidence of an inadvertent error, such as a lapsus calami or a copyist's or printer's error, it must be corrected. Incorrect transliteration or latinization, or use of an inappropriate connecting vowel, are not to be considered inadvertent errors…"". In this specific case, the authors clearly describe the position of ""Masafucra"" (=Masafuera) island within the Pacific Ocean, with an exact distance from the nearest island (Juan Fernandez), leaving no doubt that they refer to Masafuera and not to some alternative island. This is clear evidence within the text that is indicative of an inadvertent error."	
16143	N-33	"Sylviorthorhynchus desmursii has also been used. The spelling desmurii is the original one, and there are strong indications that it was not an inadvertent error, as it was used multiple times by Oeillet Des Murs himself. The spelling desmursii is an incorrect subsequent spelling predominantly propagated by Peters’ Checklist. There is much controversy over whether this incorrect subsequent spelling is in prevailing usage. The Code's interpretation is strictly tied to the definition of terms in its Glossary, where prevailing usage is defined as the usage by ""authors"" in their ""work"". The Glossary has no official definition of ""author"". However, its definition of ""work"" includes ""any text or illustration, whether published, unpublished, or carrying a disclaimer"". So clearly, the usage in sources other than peer-reviewed papers also counts towards ""prevailing usage"" and a conventional Google search could be viewed as providing a fair arbitration on current usage. At the time of assessment, the usage of desmursii on Google Scholar was more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the original spelling, but on conventional Google, it was used more frequently at only less than one order of magnitude, with a rising trend for the use of desmurii following the discovery that it had been the intended spelling. Hence, a narrow majority of our community felt that the incorrect spelling desmursii had not obtained sufficient prevailing usage (or had lost a sufficient part of it in recent years) to warrant its perpetuation as ""in prevailing usage"", resulting in the re-acceptance of the original spelling desmurii."	
16150	736	"The polytypic Leptasthenura aegithaloides complex is treated as a single species pending further research. Sometimes split into multiple species with considerable variation in plumage and vocalizations among the component taxa (Jaramillo 2003; Boesman 2016vv; Pearman & Areta 2020). Genomic data (Harvey et al. 2020) recovered L. aegithaloides as paraphyletic, suggesting splits are warranted, but any splits are deferred pending publication of current research with more comprehensive taxon sampling."	
16179	737	"Taxon inornatus (polytypic, including castilloi) is treated as a species separate from Phacellodomus rufifrons based on differences in plumage, vocalizations (Boesman 2016ww), and divergence in mitochondrial DNA and genomic data (Corbett et al. 2020). Vocal and genetic data suggest that additional splits may be warranted; further research needed."	
16204	738	Three species are recognized in the Asthenes dorbignyi sensu lato complex based mostly on differences in vocalizations (Boesman 2016aaa) and plumage: a monotypic A. arequipae; a polytypic A. huancavelicae (including usheri); and a polytypic A. dorbignyi (including consobrina). This arrangement was suggested by Fjeldså & Krabbe (1990) and is supported by genomic DNA data (Harvey et al. 2020); at least two additional taxa in this group are yet to be described.	
16230	739	"Taxon sclateri (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Asthenes wyatti based on similarity in plumage and vocalizations (Fjeldså & Krabbe 1990), supported by modest divergence in mitochondrial-dominated DNA (Derryberry et al. 2011) and genomic data (Harvey et al. 2020). Introgression has also been reported between these groups (F. Vuilleumier in Vaurie 1980; Fjeldså & Krabbe 1990) although a detailed study of the contact zone is lacking. Nevertheless, a comprehensive genetic and bioacoustic review of this complex would be informative."	
16311	740	"Taxon berlepschi is placed in the genus Cranioleuca (rather than Thripophaga) based on vocalizations (T. A. Parker in Collar et al. 1992), and genetic data from mitochondrial-dominated DNA (Derryberry et al. 2011) and genomic (Harvey et al. 2020) analyses. Taxon sulphuriferus is placed in the genus Limnoctites (rather than Cranioleuca) as genetic data (Derryberry et al. 2011; Harvey et al. 2020) recovered it as sister to L. rectirostris. Taxon gutturata is placed in the genus Thripophaga (rather than Cranioleuca) based on genetic data (Derryberry et al. 2011; Harvey et al. 2020)."	
16324	743	"Taxon weskei is treated as a monotypic species separate from Cranioleuca marcapatae based on differences in plumage and vocalizations (Boesman 2016a). However, a more detailed investigation of vocalizations and assessment of possible introgression (Hosner et al. 2015) is warranted."	
16362	741	"Taxon baroni (polytypic, including capitalis and zaratensis) is treated as conspecific with Cranioleuca antisiensis based on available evidence. There is considerable variation in size, plumage, and vocalizations among populations, but most traits vary clinally (Seeholzer & Brumfield 2018). Genomic data also demonstrate clinal variation in population structure (Seeholzer & Brumfield 2018) and weak divergence (Harvey et al. 2020), consistent with all taxa being retained as C. antisiensis."	
16406	742	"Taxon simoni is treated as a monotypic species separate from Synallaxis albilora based on differences in vocalizations (Boesman 2016b), supported by plumages. Genetic data would be informative."	
16561	983	The Ailuroedus buccoides complex is treated as three species based on the genome-wide and mito-genomic data of Ericson et al. (2020): monotypic A. buccoides; polytypic A. geislerorum (including molestus); and polytypic A. stonii (including cinnamomeus).	
16568	984	"The Ailuroedus melanotis complex is treated as three species based on the genome-wide and mito-genomic data of Ericson et al. (2020): monotypic A. crassirostris in central east Australia; monotypic A. maculosus in wet northeast Queensland (Townsville to Cooktown); and polytypic A. melanotis (montane New Guinea, Arafura lowlands, east Cape York Peninsula)."	
16581	982	"Taxon newtoniana is placed in the monospecific genus Prionodura based on the genome-wide and mito-genomic data of Ericson et al. (2020). Formerly placed in Amblyornis, P. newtoniana differs from members of that genus in plumage pattern, egg form and colour, and bower structure."	
16600	988	"The Amytornis striatus sensu lato complex is treated as four species based on a combination of genetic, plumage, and ecological differences following Christidis et al. (2010, 2013): A. whitei; A. oweni; A. striatus; and A. rowleyi. Sometimes treated as three species (Black et al. 2020) based on a lack of mitochondrial DNA divergence between whitei and oweni, strong ecological differences between these relatively cryptic taxa suggest that they are better treated as species pending further research. A genomic DNA perspective is needed to confirm species and subspecies limits in this complex."	
16650	987	Taxon campbelli is treated as a species separate from Chenorhamphus grayi based mostly on mitochondrial DNA divergence (Driskell et al. 2011; Marki et al. 2017) supported by plumage differences (Schodde 1982a) and biogeography. An assessment based on genomic DNA would be informative.	
16777	233	"Taxon citrina is treated as a monotypic species separate from Gerygone flavolateralis (polytypic) based on plumage, eye color, morphology, and vocal differences between citrina and nominate flavolateralis. A more detailed bioacoustic analysis of this complex would be desirable."	
16865	244	Genus name revisions following Norman et al. (2018) are: Hylacola pyrrhopygia becomes Calamanthus pyrrhopygius; Hylacola cauta becomes Calamanthus cautus; Origma murina becomes Crateroscelis murina; Origma robusta becomes Crateroscelis robusta; and Aethomyias nigrorufus becomes Crateroscelis nigrorufa.	
16904	236	Taxon citreogularis is placed in the monotypic genus Neosericornis following Norman et al. (2018).	
16908	237	"The genus Aethomyias is used for A. rufescens, A. perspicillatus, A. arfakianus, A. papuensis and A. spilodera following Norman et al. (2018)."	
16927	234	Taxon maculatus (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Sericornis frontalis (polytypic) on the basis of plumage and genetics following Norman et al. (2018). Differences in eye color (Cake 2019) largely support this split except that subspecies ashbyi aligns with the frontalis group; genomic data would be informative.	
16950	235	"Taxon virgatus (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Sericornis nouhuysi (polytypic) following Beehler & Pratt (2016). Species and subspecies limits in this group are uncertain, and taxon virgatus, sometimes treated as a species, has also been described as a series of hybrid populations between nouhuysi and beccarii (Beehler & Pratt 2016). Further research, including genetic and bioacoustic analyses, is needed."	
16980	980	"The genus Melionyx (polytypic, including fuscus, princeps, and nouhuysi) is recognized based on multilocus DNA (Marki et al. 2017) and genomic DNA (Andersen et al. 2019; Hay et al. 2022) data. Formerly placed in Melidectes, genetic studies indicate that the two genera are widely paraphyletic."	
17039	979	"Monotypic taxa undulata and notabilis are placed in the genus Gliciphila based on genetics. Sometimes separated in the genus Glycifohia, multilocus DNA data (Andersen et al. 2014b; Marki et al. 2017) indicate that the genus may not be monophyletic. Biogeographic distributions are also more consistent with treatment of the three species (including G. melanops) within the genus Gliciphila."	
17070	N-38	"Sugomel niger has also been used. According to ICZN Code Article 30.1.3, ""…a genus-group name that is or ends in a Latin word takes the gender given for that word in standard Latin dictionaries."" ""Mel"" is a neuter nominative singular Latin noun, meaning ""honey"". It is inconsequential that Mathews (in 1924) applied a masculine species name to a genus established by Mathews (in 1922). The correct gender needs to be established in the original publication. Hence Article 30.1.1 applies, and Sugomel must be neuter."	
17086	969	"The Myzomela obscura sensu lato complex is treated as four species based on a combination of genetics, plumage, and vocalizations: M. obscura (polytypic); M. simplex (polytypic); M. rubrotincta (monotypic); and M. rubrobrunnea (monotypic). Mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Marki et al. 2017) indicate that M. obscura sensu lato is paraphyletic, with rubrotincta recovered as a deeply divergent lineage from Australian obscura. Subsequent re-evaluation of plumage and vocal differences suggests that the other reddish-tinted members of the M. obscura sensu lato complex, simplex and rubrobrunnea, also warrant separation as species. Nevertheless, a comprehensive morphological, bioacoustic, and genetic review is needed to confirm proposed species limits in this complex."	
17095	970	"Taxon erythrina (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Myzomela cruentata based on differences in plumage and ecology. However, detailed bioacoustic and genetic studies are needed to confirm species limits in this complex."	
17115	971	"Myzomela irianawidodoae is recognized as a distinct species based on Prawiradilaga et al. (2017). Sometimes treated as a subspecies of M. dammermani, but differs in vocalizations and plumage at a level considered consistent with other species in this complex. Nevertheless, a comprehensive genetic review of the red-headed Myzomela complex is needed to substantiate this split."	
17117	973	"Taxon batjanensis is treated as a species separate from Myzomela chloroptera based on differences in plumage and vocalizations (Eaton et al. 2016, 2021), supported by biogeographic considerations. Nevertheless, a detailed genetic review of this complex is needed."	
17122	972	"The newly described taxon Myzomela wahe is recognized as a distinct species based on differences in plumage, ecology, and mitochondrial DNA (Rheindt et al. 2020). Nevertheless, a more detailed genetic review is needed to substantiate this split."	
17139	974	Taxon nigriventris is treated as a species separate from Myzomela cardinalis based on differences in plumage and vocalizations following Pratt & Mittermeier (2016). Genetic data would be informative.	
17167	975	"Taxon longirostris is treated as a species separate from Myzomela rosenbergii based on differences in female plumage, size (especially bill length), and biogeographic considerations. Genetic and bioacoustic data would be informative."	
17208	978	"Taxa novaeguineae (polytypic) and yorki (monotypic) are treated as conspecific with Philemon buceroides pending further research. Mitochondrial DNA (Jønsson et al. 2016) and genomic (Peñalba et al. 2019) data have recovered relationships within the P. buceroides sensu lato complex that are inconsistent with the proposed taxonomic arrangement. In particular, the mitochondrial DNA-based study of Jønsson et al. (2016) failed to recover buceroides and novaeguineae as monophyletic groups; further research will be needed to determine species limits in this complex."	
17289	977	"Taxon albipennis is treated as a subspecies of Entomyzon cyanotis based on apparent clinality in plumage and morphological traits, similarity in voice and behavior, although showing moderate genetic divergence across mitochondrial DNA (Toon et al. 2020) and genomic (Peñalba et al. 2019) datasets."	
17306	976	"Taxon laetior is treated as a subspecies of Melithreptus gularis based on available evidence. Despite differences in plumage and vocalizations, there is a broad zone of intergradation between laetior and gularis, and genetic divergence is consistent with subspecific differentiation based on mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Toon et al. 2010)."	
17315	981	"A broad Meliphaga comprising 17 species and four subgenera (Meliphaga, Territornis, Microptilotis, and Oreornis) is recognized based on multilocus DNA and genomic data (Marki et al. 2017; Andersen et al. 2019; McCullough et al. 2019; Hay et al. 2022), supported by morphology and ecology. Although Meliphaga was split into three genera based on paraphyly with Oreornis (McCullough et al. 2019), Oreornis is better treated as a large-bodied Meliphaga, thus restoring monophyly to the genus."	
17331	1146	"Taxon rara is treated as a synonym of Meliphaga analoga following Rand (1942) and Beehler & Pratt (2016). Erroneously described as a race of M. mimikae by Salomonsen (1966), the single specimen is considered an aberrant individual of M. analoga based on its size and distribution, including the elevation of collection."	
17452	967	"Taxon isidorei is placed in the monospecific genus Garritornis based on genetics, supported by differences in plumage, habitat, and nest form. Formerly placed in Pomatostomus, mitochondrial DNA data (Edwards & Wilson 1990) recovered isidorei as a deeply diverged basal lineage."	
17493	880	"Taxon clarum (including fordianum and morgani) is treated as a species separate from Cinclosoma castanotum based on genetic evidence from mitochondrial DNA (Toon et al. 2012; Dolman & Joseph 2015), multilocus data (Dolman & Joseph 2016), and genomic analyses (McElroy et al. 2020). Although plumages show a leapfrog pattern, the sharp transition between clarum and castanotum in eastern Australia is consistent with the recognition of two species."	
17524	1090	"Taxon montanus (polytypic, including cinereigula) is treated as conspecific with Pericrocotus solaris pending further research. Although sometimes treated as a separate species based on plumage, vocal, and genetic differences, compelling demonstrations of vocal differentiation remain lacking, mtDNA divergence (Jønsson et al. 2010a) is borderline, and plumage differences are limited. Future analyses based on a more comprehensive and deeper sampling across these data types may provide support for this split."	
17548	1089	"Taxa in the speciosus group are treated as conspecific with Pericrocotus flammeus pending publication of a comprehensive taxonomic review of this complex incorporating genetic, bioacoustic, and phenotypic analyses. While flammeus is now usually split based on vocal and plumage differences (Rasmussen and Anderton 2005), supported by moderate genomic divergence (McCullough et al. 2022), patterns of diversity are suggestive of multiple species in this complex, with Indonesian siebersi and exul being an especially distinctive group, as are some Philippine taxa, based on plumage, size, and vocalizations, and this issue requires reevaluation for a future version of AviList."	
17571	1243	"Taxon stanfordi has sometimes been recognized as a subspecies of Pericrocotus roseus (e.g., Clements et al. 2019), but has more recently been treated as a hybrid between P. cantonensis and P. roseus (Taylor 2023) and we follow that treatment here."	
17572	1023	"The genus Ceblepyris (polytypic, type species cinereus) is recognized based on the genetic studies of Jønsson et al. (2010b) and McCullough et al. (2022). Both multilocus DNA and genomic data recovered Ceblepyris as a clade, deeply diverged from other species in the genus Coracina. Further research needed to clarify the status of Ceblepyris cucullatus as a full species, or as a subspecies of C. cinereus; genetic data for this taxon are lacking."	
17616	1086	"Taxon ingens is treated as a subspecies of Coracina papuensis based on available evidence. Sometimes afforded monotypic species status based on its heavier bill, much larger size, and darker plumage, but mitochondrial DNA divergence falls within the range of other subspecies sampled (e.g., Fuchs et al. 2007b; Smith & Filardi 2007; Jønsson et al. 2010b) when compiling data across independent studies; further research needed."	
17639	1088a	"Taxon macei (polytypic, including layardi) is treated as a separate species from the Himalayan and Southeast Asian nipalensis group of cuckooshrikes, now placed within Coracina javensis, based on the more extensive barring below in both sexes, smaller size, and distinctly inflected primary vocalizations (Rasmussen & Anderton 2005; Boesman 2016e)."	
17642	1088b	"The nipalensis group of cuckooshrikes (nipalensis, andamana, siamensis, rexpineti, and larvivora) are treated as subspecies of Coracina javensis based on plumage and vocalizations, supported by limited mitochondrial DNA data. While Pepke et al. (2019) showed nominate javensis and a sample from Thailand (presumably siamensis but designated larvivora) to be weakly differentiated, a comprehensive genetic review of this complex would be informative. In particular, taxon rexpineti differs vocally from the others; further study required."	
17649	1088c	"Taxon larutensis is treated as a species separate from Coracina macei and C. javensis based on differences in vocalizations, plumage, and ecology (Eaton et al. 2016; Puan et al. 2020); larutensis is the only taxon in this complex restricted to montane forest habitat."	
17650	1214	"The Coracina striata complex is divided into five species based on a combination of mitochondrial DNA data (Jønsson et al. 2010b; Campbell et al. 2016; Boyce et al. 2019), vocalizations, eye color, and plumage: Coracina guillemardi (monotypic); C. mindorensis (monotypic); C. panayensis (monotypic); C. kochii (polytypic, including boholensis); and C. striata (all other former subspecies). However, comprehensive genomic data with dense taxon sampling, along with rigorous bioacoustic and morphological analyses, are needed to corroborate these preliminary splits and to test for additional species-level diversity. In particular, the status and/or affinities of populations of mindorensis from Tablas and surrounding islands that are possibly vocally divergent, taxon boholensis of the East Visayas which appears to have red eyes like C. panayensis, and the extinct cebuensis, need to be assessed."	
17679	1091	"Generic assignments in Campephagidae have been adjusted according to information from multilocus DNA data (McCullough et al. 2022) indicating the existence of a deeply-diverged monospecific genus for Celebesica abbotti, the embedment of parvula within Coracina, and the placement of anale, caerulescens, and ostentum (sometimes separated in the genus Analisoma) in a basal position within the genus Edolisoma."	
17730	1074	"Taxon leucoptera is treated as a species separate from Lalage atrovirens based on strong differentiation in vocalizations and plumage (e.g., Beehler & Pratt 2016)."	
17749	1073	"Taxon minor is treated as a subspecies of Lalage melanoleuca based on available evidence. Sometimes treated as a monotypic species based on female plumage, minor size differences, and song, however, plumage differences are subtle and somewhat variable, and vocalizations are incompletely known. Future genomic, bioacoustic, and phenotype data will be needed to evaluate the veracity of a potential split."	
17794	1226	"A preliminary taxonomic reassessment of the highly polytypic Common Cicadabird (Edolisoma tenuirostre) complex recognizes 25 species based on integration of genomic DNA data (McCullough et al. 2022) with assessments of plumage and vocalizations (e.g., Eaton et al. 2021), supplemented with insights from mitochondrial DNA (Pedersen et al. 2018), as follows: E. salvadorii (including talautense) is split from E. morio (including edithae) based on female plumage and mitochondrial DNA; eight monotypic species are recognized, with E. admiralitatis split from the remotum group based primarily on genomic divergence, E. amboinense based on female plumage and biogeographic considerations, E. rostratum based on female plumage, bioacoustic, and mitochondrial DNA evidence, E. pelingi and E. obiense based on their distinctive female plumages, and E. monacha, E. nesiotis, and E. insperatum based on distinct plumages, geographic isolation, and—in some cases—distinct mtDNA; and six polytypic species with novel taxon arrangements are recognized—E. meyerii (including numforanum) is split from E. tenuirostre based on its distinct plumage, as well as suggestive genetic and bioacoustic evidence, E. timoriense (including emancipatum and kalaotuae) is separated from E. tenuirostre mainly based on bioacoustic and mtDNA evidence, E. grayi (including pererratum) based on plumage and vocalizations, but it may form a species complex with E. amboinense, E. remotum (including matthiae, heinrothi and ultimum), and E. erythropygium (including rooki, nisorium, and saturatius) based mainly on genomic and mtDNA evidence, and a reduced E. tenuirostre (including melvillense, tagulanum, aruense, muellerii, and nehrkorni). The remaining nine species are unchanged. Further research is needed, including genomic, bioacoustic, and morphological analyses, to affirm some of these novel taxonomic treatments and to check for additional species-level diversity in the complex."	
17818	1085	"Taxon tricolor is treated as a species separate from Edolisoma holopolium based on mitochondrial DNA divergence (Pedersen et al. 2018), supported by differences in plumage and possibly voice. Taxon pygmaeum, sometimes split as a monotypic species, is treated as a subspecies of E. holopolium, as its plumage divergence appears less pronounced, vocal differences require further corroboration, and genetic data are lacking; further research needed."	
17885	N-14	"Although Artamus leucoryn has been used (HBW), leucorynchus was formally decided by the ICZN (2020) in Opinion 2455 (Case 3715)."	
17932	873	"Taxon quoyi is placed in the monospecific genus Melloria based mostly on mitochondrial DNA evidence that it is not closely related to other Cracticus butcherbirds (Kearns et al. 2013). However, genomic data are needed to determine relationships between Melloria, Cracticus, and Gymnorhina, as these remain poorly resolved."	
18011	494	"Taxon minuta is retained in the monotypic genus Bocagia based on genetics (Fuchs et al. 2012b) and sexual differences in plumage (Harris & Franklin 2000). Nonetheless, it remains closely aligned with the genus Tchagra."	
18084	498	"Taxon cruentus is retained in the monotypic genus Rhodophoneus based on morphology, ecology, and genetics. A combined analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA placed R. cruentus as a divergent sister lineage to a polytypic Telophorus (only nominate zeylonus and dohertyi included) (Fuchs et al. 2012b). Differences in morphology, proportions, and ecology (e.g., Harris & Franklin 2000), are also considered sufficient to warrant generic recognition."	
18090	495	"Chlorophoneus (polytypic) is retained as a genus distinct from Telophorus (polytypic) based on combined nuclear and mitochondrial DNA data (Fuchs et al. 2004, 2006, 2012b; Nguembock et al. 2008), although sequences from the type species C. olivaceus were not included."	
18134	496	Laniarius major (polytypic) is provisionally split from L. aethiopicus (monotypic) based on available mitochondrial DNA evidence (Nguembock et al. 2008). Broader geographic and genetic sampling is needed to determine species limits in these groups.	
18161	497	"Taxon willardi is split from Laniarius poensis based on a combination of traits (Voelker et al. 2010). Vocalizations and morphometrics separate willardi from polytypic L. poensis, although its purportedly distinctive grey iris is reportedly shared with L. p. camerunensis. Mitochondrial DNA recovered willardi and L. p. camerunensis as divergent sister lineages (Voelker et al. 2010) but nominate poensis was not included in the analysis. A previous mitochondrial DNA study (Nguembock et al. 2008) aligned L. p. camerunensis with L. holomelas, possibly in error; further genetic research is desirable to affirm species status and resolve phylogenetic inconsistencies in this complex."	
18172	507	"The genus Dyaphorophyia is restricted to three species (D. castanea, D. hormophora, and D. tonsa), and the remaining species (concreta, blissetti, jamesoni, and chalybea) placed in an enlarged Platysteira based on relationships inferred using both mitochondrial (Njabo et al. 2008; Fuchs et al. 2012; Erard et al. 2019) and nuclear (Njabo et al. 2008) DNA data."	
18190	508	"Taxon ansorgei is retained as a subspecies of Platysteira concreta pending further investigation. Considerable variation in plumage (Harris & Franklin 2000) occurs within P. concreta sensu lato, but a more comprehensive analysis of behavior and vocalizations is required. While mitochondrial DNA analyses have identified some deep divergences within the complex (Njabo et al. 2008; Fuchs et al. 2004; Erard et al. 2019), taxon sampling is incomplete, making any splits premature."	
18199	510	Taxon reichenowi is retained as a subspecies of Batis mixta based on genetic evidence and reassessment of plumages following Fjeldså et al. (2006). Plumages within this complex are variable and mitochondrial DNA data showed reichenowi nested within B. mixta; genomic and vocal evidence would be needed to justify a split.	
18204	509	"Taxon dimorpha (polytypic, including sola) is treated as a species separate from Batis capensis (polytypic) based on differences in plumage, bill length, vocalizations, and genetics (Fjeldså et al. 2006; Fjeldså & Bowie 2021). In addition, both species occur in Malawi, with B. c. erythrophthalma identified from the Zomba Plateau, indicating parapatry or sympatry."	
18332	511	"Taxon comorensis is tentatively treated as a species distinct from Cyanolanius madagascarinus based on differences in plumages and proportions. As vocalizations are relatively conserved in vangas, genomic data will be needed to affirm this split."	
18381	242	"Taxon leucogaster (polytypic, including lashmari) is treated as conspecific with Psophodes nigrogularis based on available evidence. Although mtDNA data (Burbidge et al. 2017) identified two clades with moderate divergence, vocalizations are similar, and the genetic break does not align with geographic patterns in plumage or morphometrics (Schodde & Mason 1999; Burbidge et al. 2017). Given the potential for mtDNA capture between parapatric taxa, further research based on nuclear or genomic DNA data would be informative."	
18405	240	"Falcunculus frontatus sensu lato is treated as three monotypic species based on clear differences in phenotype (Schodde & Mason 1999), and vocalizations (though sample sizes small): F. frontatus; F. whitei; and F. leucogaster. Genetic data would be informative."	
18412	966	"Taxon olivacea is treated as a monotypic species separate from Paramythia montium based on differences in plumage, especially crest form, and mitochondrial DNA data (Jønsson et al. 2019). Further research needed to determine validity of subspecific taxa in both species (see Beehler & Pratt 2016)."	
18418	232	"Taxa ripleyi (monotypic) and annamensis (monotypic) are treated as subspecies of Pteruthius aeralatus (polytypic) based on available evidence. Although clearly diagnosable on mitochondrial DNA (Reddy 2008), patterns of vocal and plumage differences are more complex (Rheindt & Eaton 2009; Boesman 2016yy); further research including formal bioacoustic analyses and genomic data needed."	
18435	231	"Taxon intermedius (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Pteruthius aenobarbus (monotypic) based on vocalizations, genetics, and plumage differences. Mitochondrial DNA divergence is relatively deep (Reddy 2008), and consistent vocal differences have been reported (Rheindt & Eaton 2009) but formal bioacoustic analyses are needed; plumage differences are minor."	
18476	226	Hylophilus is treated as three genera following Slager et al. (2014) and Slager & Klicka (2014): Pachysylvia (polytypic); Tunchiornis (polytypic); and a restricted Hylophilus (polytypic).	
18481	229	"Taxa insularis (monotypic) and viridiflavus (polytypic, including xuthus) are treated as conspecific with Hylophilus flavipes based on available evidence. Geographical variation in plumage and vocalizations appear to be complex and further work is needed to establish if this is clinal variation. Genetic data would be informative."	
18494	225	"Taxon griseiventris (polytypic, including aemulus) is treated as conspecific with Hylophilus thoracicus based on available evidence. Differences in plumage and vocalizations are relatively minor and genetic data for nominate thoracicus are lacking; further research needed."	
18509	222	"Taxon mikettae (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Vireolanius leucotis (polytypic) pending further research. Limited mitochondrial DNA data (Slager et al. 2014) indicate that V. leucotis sensu lato is non-monophyletic with mikettae recovered as a deeply diverged lineage. While phenotypic and vocal differences occur, they have not been quantitatively analysed; further research with increased geographic and genetic sampling is needed."	
18515	228	"Tunchiornis ochraceiceps sensu lato is treated as four species based on the genetic, morphological, and vocal analyses of Buainain et al. (2021): T. ochraceiceps; T. luteifrons; T. ferrugineifrons; and T. rubrifrons. Although plumage and vocal differences were not pronounced between T. ochraceiceps and T. ferrugineifrons, they were clearly separable based on mitochondrial DNA and genomic data (Buainain et al. 2021)."	
18552	230	"Taxon hypochryseus is retained in the genus Vireo pending further research. While nuclear DNA data support placement of hypochryseus within Pachysylvia (Slager et al. 2014), results from mitochondrial DNA data have been inconsistent (Arbeláez-Cortés et al. 2014; Slager et al. 2014; Mejías et al. 2020); further research needed."	
18638	224	"Although it has been treated either as a monotypic species or as a subspecies of Vireo crassirostris, taxon approximans (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Vireo pallens (polytypic) based on plumage and vocalizations."	
18734	779	"Taxon finschi (monotypic) is treated as a species separate from Oriolus melanotis (monotypic) based on pronounced differences in plumage and vocalizations, supported by mitochondrial DNA data (Jønsson et al. 2019b)."	
18737	711	"Taxon consobrinus (polytypic, including persuasus) is treated as a species separate from Oriolus xanthonotus based on genomic, bioacoustic, biometric, and morphological evidence (Rheindt et al. 2022)."	
18758	780	"Taxon consanguineus (polytypic, including malayanus and vulneratus) is treated as a species separate from Oriolus cruentus (monotypic) based on differences in female plumage coloration and vocalizations (Eaton et al. 2021), supported by mitochondrial DNA data (Jønsson et al. 2019b)."	
18836	1063	"All taxa in the Colluricincla megarhyncha complex are treated as subspecies pending further research. Although sometimes split into 7 species (polytypic C. megarhyncha; polytypic C. fortis; monotypic C. affinis; polytypic C. obscura; monotypic C. discolor; polytypic C. tappenbecki; and polytypic C. rufogaster) based on deep mitochondrial DNA divergences (Deiner et al. 2011; Marki et al. 2018), there is widespread paraphyly within most of the major clades, and possible evidence of intergradation between some clades. A comprehensive genomic DNA study will be needed to confidently determine species and subspecies limits in this complex; supporting information from vocalizations would be desirable."	
18875	"1065, 1066"	"1065)) Species limits in the Pachycephala pectoralis (Golden Whistler) complex follow the IOC arrangement (in use for versions 11.1 to 14.1) except that: P. teysmanni is treated as a separate species; taxa par and compar are treated as subspecies of P. orpheus; and taxon dammeriana is treated as a subspecies of P. melanura. This reclassification is mostly based on the genomic DNA data of Brady et al. (2022), supported in parts by mitochondrial DNA (Jønsson et al. 2014) and multilocus DNA data (Andersen et al. 2014), plumages, and biogeographic considerations. However, taxon sampling in the genomic DNA study of Brady et al. (2022) is incomplete and further research on species limits in this complex is warranted. 1066)) Taxa par and compar are treated as subspecies of Pachycephala orpheus based on the mitochondrial DNA data of Jønsson et al. (2014), supported by male plumage and biogeographic considerations. Sometimes treated as a separate species (P. par, including ssp. compar), or as subspecies of P. macrorhyncha, but readily distinguished from the latter by the presence of hen-plumaged males, a trait that aligns them with P. orpheus."

Sometimes treated as a separate species (P. par, including ssp. compar), or as subspecies of P. macrorhyncha, but readily distinguished from the latter by the hen-plumaged males, a trait that aligns them with P. orpheus."	
18893	1207	"The yellow-throated graeffii group is treated as a species separate from the white-throated Pachycephala vitiensis group based on a combination of plumage, vocalizations, and genetics. Mitochondrial DNA data (Andersen et al. 2014) recovered P. vitiensis as polyphyletic, with some deep divergences suggesting there may be multiple species in this complex. Most members of the graeffii group formed a well-supported clade, and this split is also supported by major vocal differences between graeffii and kandavensis. However, comprehensive genetic and bioacoustic analyses are lacking and further research is needed to determine species limits in this complex; in particular the placement of torquata, which was not recovered as part of the graeffii group based on mtDNA (Andersen et al. 2014), and the status of taxa lauana and kandavensis, which were recovered as divergent lineages within the P. vitiensis complex (Andersen et al. 2014)."

Although recovered as sister to P. phaionota, this is based on alignment of a short mitochondrial DNA segment; further research will be needed to corroborate this placement."	
19003	1067	"Taxon griseiceps (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Pachycephala simplex pending further research. Sometimes treated as a separate species based on plumage and voice; however, taxon rufipennis, a member of the brown whistler group, is phenotypically intermediate, and mitochondrial DNA divergence (Jønsson et al. 2014) between simplex and members of the griseiceps group is modest. Although genomic data (Brady et al. 2022) indicate that a deep divergence occurs within the P. simplex sensu lato complex, taxon sampling is too limited to draw taxonomic conclusions; a comprehensive integrative analysis of plumage, vocalizations, and genetics, is needed."

19043	1179	"Lamproliidae is merged into Rhipiduridae as a distinct subfamily based on genetic evidence. Previously placed in different families, Chaetorhynchus aligned with Dicruridae, Eutrichomyias with Monarchidae, and Lamprolia with Maluridae, Monarchidae, or Paradisaeidae (Schodde & Christidis 2014), however, nuclear and genomic DNA data (Irestedt et al. 2008; Jønsson et al. 2018; Oliveros et al. 2019) united them in a clade sister to Rhipiduridae. Treating them as a subfamily clarifies their relationships within the Corvoidea and marks their distinction from the rest of the Rhipiduridae."	
19064	852	"Taxon coultasi is treated as a monotypic species separate from Rhipidura cockerelli based on differences in plumage, supported by limited vocal material. Mitochondrial DNA data (Smith & Filardi 2007) suggest that albina may also warrant species status, although coultasi was not included in the analysis.

Mitochondrial DNA data (Fuchs et al. 2017b, 2018b) do not recover D. ludwigii sensu lato as monophyletic, with sharpei being more closely aligned to D. atripennis. Although a relatively deep mtDNA divergence separates sharpei and occidentalis (Fuchs et al. 2018b) they are treated as conspecific pending further research."	
19325	699	"Taxon divaricatus (polytypic, including lugubris) is treated as conspecific with Dicrurus adsimilis based on available evidence. Phenotypic differences are not pronounced (shade of plumage gloss, and length of wing and tail fork), and nuclear DNA data (Fuchs et al. 2018a) recover them as monophyletic. Earlier suggestions of non-monophyly based on a short section of mitochondrial DNA (Fuchs et al. 2017b) appear to be the result of mitochondrial DNA capture in divaricatus west of Lake Chad."

Genetic evidence is contradictory; although mitochondrial DNA data suggest non-monophyly of D. modestus sensu lato (Fuchs et al. 2017b, 2018a), this is not supported by nuclear DNA data (Fuchs et al. 2018a); further research investigating levels of gene flow would be informative."	
19355	1055	"Taxon bivittatus (polytypic, including vivax and megalolophus) is treated as conspecific with Trochocercus cyanomelas based on available evidence. As divergence in plumage traits and multilocus DNA data (Andersen et al. 2015b) are considered borderline, and vocal differences have not been identified, bivittatus and cyanomelas are best treated as conspecific pending further research."

However, divergence across all three datasets is considered borderline and further research is needed to affirm this split."

Mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Andersen et al. 2015b) recovered smithii embedded within rufiventer and differences in plumage are no more pronounced than some other subspecies in this complex. A comprehensive genomic review, supported by phenotypic and vocal data, is needed to determine species limits in this complex."	
19535	1050	"Taxon eichhorni (polytypic, including cervinicolor) is treated as a species separate from Myiagra hebetior based on a combination of plumage, vocalizations, behavior, and genetics. Although cervinicolor is sometimes split as a species, multilocus DNA data (Andersen et al. 2015b) show it to be closely related to eichhorni. As genetic data for nominate hebetior is lacking, a more thorough genetic review of the complex is warranted."

The genomic DNA study of McCullough et al. (2021) recovered S. trivirgatus sensu lato as paraphyletic, with the Moluccan taxa (bimaculatus, diadematus, and nigrimentum) forming a clade that is sister to S. guttula. Mitogenomic data (Andersen et al. 2021) were unable to resolve phylogenetic relationships in this complex due to the confounding effects of mitochondrial DNA capture. 1186)) Taxon melanopterus is treated as a monotypic species separate from Symposiachrus trivirgatus based on deep divergence in mitochondrial and genomic DNA data (McCullough et al. 2021), supported by plumage differences."

19598	1059	"Taxon rugensis is placed in the monospecific genus Metabolus, while taxa takatsukasae and godeffroyi are placed in Monarcha. Mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Andersen et al. 2015b) recovered these species, along with Pomarea nigra and P. dimidiata, as an unresolved polytomy at the base of the main Monarcha assemblage. Given the nomenclatural issues that arise due to paraphyly of Pomarea, and lack of statistical support for alternative generic arrangements among these 5 species, the IOC 13.2 classification has been adopted pending a comprehensive genomic review of the complex."	
19613	1054	"Two species are recognized in the Chestnut-bellied Monarch complex based on available evidence: polytypic Monarcha castaneiventris and monotypic M. richardsii. Species limits in this complex are poorly understood and there are incongruences between phenotypic and genetic datasets. Although M. richardsii has been treated as a species based on plumage, it is embedded within M. castaneiventris based on multilocus DNA data (Andersen et al. 2015b), a pattern that could result from mitochondrial DNA introgression. Further research will be needed to determine species limits in this complex."	
19628	N-68	"Dickinson et al. (2019b) lectotypified the specific names pomarea and maupitiensis in a way that the former refers to Tahiti birds and the latter to those from Maupiti. Hence, Pomarea maupitiensis is the correct name for Maupiti Monarch."	
19687	874	"Taxon obiensis is treated as a separate species to Lycocorax pyrrhopterus (polytypic) based on plumage, voice, and behavior. Although taxon morotensis is sometimes split, the morphological and vocal differences from L. pyrrhopterus are less pronounced; further research needed."	
19717	875	"Taxon helenae is treated as a separate species from Parotia lawesii based on male narial tuft morphology and bill proportions (Schodde & McKean 1973b), and apparent parapatry. However, mitochondrial differences are limited (Irestedt et al. 2009), and their courtship displays are similar (Scholes 2008); further research needed to affirm this split."	
19731	877	"The riflebirds are placed in Ptiloris, rather than Lophorina, based on morphological evidence. However, mitochondrial DNA and multilocus data (Irestedt et al. 2009, 2017) indicate a deep divergence within Ptiloris which may render the genus paraphyletic; further research required."	
19732	876	"Taxon latipennis of central New Guinea (polytypic, including feminina and addenda) is treated as a species separate from Lophorina superba of western New Guinea (polytypic, including niedda), and L. minor from southeastern New Guinea, based on the mitochondrial DNA data of Irestedt et al. (2017). This treatment is also based on arguments for re-neotypification of superba to the Vogelkop population and resolution of disagreement as to the nomenclature of the western and central taxa (Schodde et al. 2021; Elliott et al. 2022). The affinities of addenda will require clarification using nuclear or genomic DNA."	
19763	878	"Taxa magnificus and respublica are placed in Diphyllodes, rather than Cicinnurus, based on the multilocus DNA data of Irestedt et al. (2009). However, a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of the birds of paradise is needed to affirm taxonomic limits in this group."

19791	965	"Taxon gigantea is placed in the monospecific genus Megalampitta based on morphology (Schodde & Christidis 2014), structure of the syrinx (Mayr 1931), and genetics (Barker et al. 2004; McCullough et al. 2022), being deeply diverged from Melampitta lugubris in genomic and multilocus DNA analyses."	
19803	1166	"Corvinella and Urolestes are accepted as monotypic genera, rather than being placed in Lanius, pending further research. Although mitochondrial (Fuchs et al. 2019) and genomic DNA (McCullough et al. 2023) data suggest that these highly sociable and distinctly-plumaged birds are deeply diverged from Lanius, taxon sampling is incomplete and phylogenetic relationships remain poorly resolved."	
19860	313	"Taxon humeralis (polytypic, including smithii and capelli) is split from Lanius collaris (polytypic) based on genetics. Mitochondrial DNA data (Fuchs et al. 2011, 2019) identified a deep divergence between the northern humeralis group and the southern collaris group. Furthermore, L. collaris sensu lato was not recovered as monophyletic, with L. souzae embedded within the complex. A more comprehensive review incorporating vocal, morphological, and genomic data is needed."	
19938	1071	"Taxon aterrimus is treated as a species separate from Platysmurus leucopterus based on plumage, structural, and vocal differences (Eaton et al. 2016, 2021). Supporting information from genetic data is desirable."

Sometimes separated as a monotypic species based on morphology, but character traits are more variable and broadly overlapping with whiteheadi. Additional information from phenotypic and genomic data will be needed to support this split."	
20033	1096	"Taxon quindiuna is treated as a subspecies of Cyanolyca armillata pending further research. Although quindiuna differs in coloration and structure, mitochondrial DNA divergence is modest (Bonaccorso 2009), and vocal differences are not discernible. Pending a more comprehensive review incorporating genomic DNA data and assessment of clinality in phenotypic traits, these differences are better treated as subspecific."	
20066	1099	"Three species are recognized in the Aphelocoma californica complex: monotypic A. insularis; polytypic A. californica; and polytypic A. woodhouseii. Although mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (McCormack et al. 2011) indicate that A. californica sensu lato is paraphyletic with respect to the sumichrasti Group (currently treated within woodhouseii), species limits in this phenotypically variable complex remain uncertain due to limited taxon sampling and lack of formal bioacoustic analyses."	
20097	1083	The genera Psilorhinus (monotypic) and Calocitta (polytypic) are merged into Cyanocorax based on the genomic data of McCullough et al. (2022). Continued recognition of these genera would render Cyanocorax paraphyletic.	
20107	N-51	"The original spelling contains an -oe (coerulea). The spelling variant with an -ae (caeruleus / caerulea) is currently used more widely, leading many taxonomists to interpret it as in prevailing usage under Article 33.3.1 of the Code. However, the level to which the latter spelling is ""prevailing"" is currently controversial, leading to a retention of the original spelling in this list."	
20113	1098	"Taxon luxuosus is treated as a subspecies of Cyanocorax yncas pending further research. Although mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Bonaccorso et al. 2010) indicate the presence of two clades, geographic sampling is limited, ventral plumage coloration is highly variable, and vocalizations have not been formally analysed. A comprehensive, integrative analysis of genetics, plumage, and vocalizations across all populations is needed to determine species limits in this group."	
20141	1097	"Taxon hafferi is treated as a subspecies of Cyanocorax heilprini based on available evidence. The bluish bare skin patches of hafferi also occur, to some extent, in heilprini, mitochondrial DNA divergence is shallow, and the two taxa are indistinguishable vocally. Analysis of genomic DNA would be informative."	
20152	1078	"The Eurasian Jay Garrulus glandarius complex is treated as a single, highly polytypic species pending further research. Although multiple species are sometimes recognized (e.g., taxa japonicus, bispecularis and leucotis) based on bioacoustic, morphological, and/or mitochondrial DNA (Aoki et al. 2018) evidence, a comprehensive analysis incorporating all taxa is lacking. Further research incorporating genomic, bioacoustic, and morphological data is needed to assess species limits in this complex."	
20193	1095	"Taxa serica (polytypic, including anderssoni) and bottanensis (monotypic) are treated as species separate from Pica pica based on mitochondrial DNA divergence (Kryukov et al. 2017; Song et al. 2018), supported by differences in plumage and/or vocalizations. A more comprehensive genetic review incorporating genomic data, and investigation of possible contact zones, would be informative."

Various other subsequent spellings have replaced it in the literature, and among these, nuttalli (with a double t and double l, but with a single i) is by far the most widely used one and enjoys prevailing usage. We here adopt a modification of this spelling, namely nuttallii (with a double i), as the double i rendition of the original spelling must not be changed according to Article 33.4."

20229	1082	"The two jackdaw species monedula and dauuricus are placed in the genus Coloeus based on genetics, supported by their distinctive vocalizations. Mitochondrial, multilocus, and genomic DNA datasets (Haring et al. 2012; Jønsson et al. 2012; Weissensteiner et al. 2020; McCullough et al. 2022) all recover monedula and dauuricus as sister species and basal to the radiation encompassing all Corvus crows."	
20240	923	"Taxon minutus is treated as a monotypic species separate from Corvus palmarum based on differences in vocalizations (Garrido et al. 1997; Boesman 2016f) and behavior (Wetmore & Swales 1931; Holyoak 1983), supported by divergence in mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Jønsson et al. 2012). Formal bioacoustic analyses, playback experiments, and quantification of reported differences in egg color are desirable."	
20273	1081	"Taxon caurinus is treated as a subspecies of Corvus brachyrhynchos based on genomic DNA evidence (Slager et al. 2020), supported by insights from mitochondrial DNA, morphology, and vocalizations. The presence of a broad genomic cline between these taxa is consistent with intergradation across a broad area with little or no evidence of assortative mating or selection against hybrids, but see Butler (2020) who suggest that areas of hybridization may be geographically restricted."	
20279	N-71	"Corvus torquatus Lesson, 1831 is the correct name for the Collared Crow. The usage of Corvus pectoralis for this species is based on the interpretation that Corvus torquatus Lesson, 1831 is a junior synonym of ""Corvus Monedula torquata"" Bechstein, 1791. However, Bechstein (1791) used the word ""torquata"" for an aberration, not for a taxonomic unit, as explicitly mentioned in his text and as shown in his capitalization practice for taxonomic units only. His introduction of ""torquata"" is not a legitimate nomenclatural taxon description, rendering Corvus torquatus Lesson, 1831 the senior name for the Collared Crow."	
20280	1080	"Taxon cornix (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Corvus corone based on available evidence. This complex is variably split into two species along distinct plumage lines: all-black C. corone (polytypic, including orientalis) and partly gray C. cornix, that form a leapfrog distributional pattern and hybridize across multiple contact zones. There is evidence of extensive mitochondrial DNA introgression within this complex, including from adjacent C. torquatus (Haring et al. 2012; Kryukov 2019), and discordance between patterns of genomic divergence and plumage coloration (Poelstra et al. 2014; Vijay et al. 2016). Furthermore, analysis of phenotype-genotype interactions across hybrid zones reveals that different genes underlie expression of all-black coloration in the widely disjunct populations of orientalis and corone (Vijay et al. 2016). These findings indicate that more research is needed to establish the number and location (if any) of species boundaries in this complex."	
20295	1070	"Taxon philippinus is treated as a species separate from other members of the Corvus macrorhynchos complex based on mitochondrial DNA paraphyly (Jønsson et al. 2012), supported by vocalizations. Although taxa levaillantii and culminatus are sometimes split from C. macrorhynchos there is insufficient evidence to confirm this split. Future genomic analysis, supplemented by bioacoustic and morphological evidence, will be needed to determine species limits within the C. macrorhynchos species complex."

(2009) with some minor revisions. Within the Eopsaltriinae, Peneothello is placed in Melanodryas, while Gennaeodryas, Quoyornis, and Tregellasia are placed in Eopsaltria, and taxon brachyurus is transferred from Poecilodryas to Heteromyias following Beehler & Pratt (2016)."	
20434	960	"Taxon dannefaerdi is treated as a subspecies of Petroica macrocephala based on available evidence. Although monochromatic plumage and lack of sexual dimorphism separate dannefaerdi from other members of the macrocephala complex, mitochondrial DNA divergence (Miller & Lambert 2006) is weak; analysis of genomic DNA is needed to determine if this is the result of mitochondrial DNA introgression."	
20451	959	"Taxon polymorpha (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Petroica pusilla (polytypic) based on a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data (Kearns et al. 2020), supported by biogeography. However, geographic patterns of phenotypic differentiation are complex, and both species contain multiple plumage morphs, complicating diagnosis."	
20487	963	"Taxon coultasi is treated as a subspecies of Monachella muelleriana based on available evidence. Phenotypic differentiation is limited, reported vocal differences have not been formally analysed, and genetic data are lacking; further research would be informative."	
20492	961	"Taxon tormenti is treated as a subspecies of Microeca flavigaster based on available evidence. Morphological differentiation is slight, plumage differences are limited to the presence/absence of flavenoid pigmentation, and hybridization occurs. In addition, formal bioacoustic analyses and genetic data are lacking; further research needed."	
20512	964	"Taxon armiti (polytypic, including rothschildi) is treated as a species separate from Heteromyias albispecularis based on differences in plumage and voice, following Beehler & Pratt (2016). In addition, taxon centralis is subsumed under rothschildi and atricapilla under nominate armiti following Beehler & Pratt (2016); genetic data would be informative."	
20516	962	"Taxon albonotata is placed in the monospecific genus Plesiodryas based on multilocus DNA data (Christidis et al. 2011), supported by juvenile plumage and niche differences."	
20521	1094	"Taxon brachyurus is placed in the monotypic genus Leucophantes based on an analysis of mitochondrial DNA data. Sometimes placed in Heteromyias (Beehler & Pratt 2016) based on shared morphological features, or Poecilodryas, mitochondrial DNA data recovered it as a deeply diverged lineage that is sister to Poecilodryas sensu stricto."	
20568	986	"Taxon pulverulenta is placed in Melanodryas based on the modified generic classification adopted for the Petroicidae. Formerly placed in Peneoenanthe, multilocus DNA data (Christidis et al. 2011) recovered it embedded within Peneothello, which has now been subsumed in Melanodryas."	
20648	673	"Remiz macronyx (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Remiz pendulinus based on comparatively strong plumage differences (Stepanyan 1978; Rasmussen & Anderton 2005). It is known to hybridize with R. pendulinus in the field, which explains the lack of deep mitochondrial divergence between the two despite significant nuclear divergence (Barani-Beiranvand et al. 2017). However, their hybridization is spatially limited, consistent with current interpretations of biological species boundaries. Genome-wide data are required to assess their gene flow interactions and confirm their taxonomic status."	
20666	672	"Taxon sylviella (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Anthoscopus caroli pending further research. Plumage differences within this complex are variable, vocalizations incompletely studied, and distributions uncertain. Reports of intergrades also need to be assessed (White 1963)."	
20734	1100	"The Parus major complex is treated as comprising two species, western and central Palaearctic Parus major and southern and eastern Asian Parus cinereus (including subspecies in the minor complex), based on the level of mitochondrial DNA divergence between them (Zhao et al. 2012; Song et al. 2020), presence of a narrow hybrid zone (Kvist & Rytkönen 2006), and vocalizations (Päckert et al. 2005)."	
20775	1102	"Taxon aplonotus is treated as a species separate from Machlolophus xanthogenys based on differences in female plumage and vocalizations (Rasmussen & Anderton 2005), supported by divergence in mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Johansson et al. 2013). However, further research is needed to affirm this split."	
20789	1025	"Taxon pallidiventris (polytypic, including stenotopicus) is treated as conspecific with Melaniparus rufiventris based on available evidence. Plumage traits vary clinally, the importance of eye color is questioned, and intergradation is widespread (Anderson 2015). Furthermore, Johansson et al.’s (2013) genetic data, which are sometimes used to support this split, do not contain DNA sequences for M. [r.] pallidiventris (see Anderson 2015)."	
20820	1101	Genus Pardaliparus is subsumed as a subgenus within Periparus based on the mitochondrial-dominated DNA data of Johansson et al. (2013); divergence between Periparus and Pardaliparus is no greater than within some other parid genera.	
21008	212	"Taxon beesleyi is treated as a monotypic species separate from Chersomanes albofasciata based on available evidence. Limited mitochondrial DNA data (Alström et al. 2013, 2023; Miller et al. 2021) indicate a deep divergence between beesleyi and some other members of this complex; however, geographically intermediate populations have not been sampled and there is some overlap in phenotypic and behavioral traits (Donald & Collar 2011); further research would be informative."	
21022	214	"Taxon benguelensis (polytypic, including kaokoensis) is treated as conspecific with Certhilauda subcoronata based on available evidence. Although mitochondrial DNA divergence is moderate (Alström et al. 2013; Stervander et al. 2020), vocal differences seem minor, and the affinities of the geographically intermediate taxon, damarensis, are uncertain (Ryan & Bloomer 1999); further research warranted."	
21033	213	"Taxon brevirostris (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Certhilauda curvirostris (polytypic) based on clinal variation in morphology, similar vocalizations, and low genetic divergence. Mitochondrial DNA data (Alström et al. 2013; Stervander et al. 2020) also suggest that C. semitorquata is part of this complex; further research needed."	
21099	1165	"Taxa gilletti (polytypic) and rufa (polytypic) are placed in the genus Calendulauda, rather than Mirafra, based on the multilocus and genomic DNA of Alström et al. (2023)."	
21118	227	"Taxon alopex (polytypic) is treated as a subspecies of Calendulauda africanoides (polytypic) based on available evidence. Mitochondrial DNA divergence is relatively weak (Alström et al. 2013), as are differences in morphology (Donald & Alström 2024)."	
21133	216	"Taxon barlowi is treated as conspecific with Calendulauda erythrochlamys (polytypic, including cavei and patae) based on similarities in morphology, vocalizations, and genetics, following Donald & Alström (2024). Mitochondrial DNA divergence is limited (Alström et al. 2013) and plumages are highly variable."	
21141	1170	The Mirafra group of larks is treated as four polytypic genera based on the multilocus and genomic DNA data of Alström et al. (2023): Mirafra; Corypha; Amirafra; and Plocealauda.	
21154	217	"Taxon cantillans (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Mirafra javanica (polytypic) based on genetics. Although the two have been recovered as monophyletic clades (Alström et al. 2013), mitochondrial DNA divergence is modest, and diagnostic plumage traits are lacking (Donald & Alström in press)."	
21198	1204	"Five new polytypic species are recognized in the genus Corypha based on integrative analysis of morphology (including plumage), vocalizations, and genetics (Alström et al. 2023, 2024): C. kidepoensis (including kathangorensis) is treated as a species separate from C. hypermetra (polytypic, including gallarum); C. athi (including harterti), C. nigrescens (including nyikae), C. kabalii (including irwini and malbranti), and C. kurrae (including bamendae, batesi, henrici, and stresemanni) are treated as species separate from C. africana. Taxon irwinii is poorly known, and sometimes synonymized with C. africana gomesi. However, based on analysis of specimens (n=2) there are clear differences from a specimen of gomesi (and the type description), and the one irwinii that has been analysed genetically was found to be very closely related to kabalii and malbranti (although gomesi has yet to be analysed genetically)."

Differences plumage and proportions (Donald & Alström 2024) also support species recognition for sharpii."	
21320	221	"Taxon macrorhyncha (polytypic, including randonii) is treated as conspecific with Galerida cristata (polytypic) based on available evidence. Mensural traits show some overlap (Donald & Alström 2024), and mitochondrial DNA evidence is inconsistent (Guillaumet et al. 2005, 2006, 2008) and geographically limited; further research is needed to determine species limits in this group."	
21445	219	"Taxon athensis (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Alaudala somalica (polytypic) based on available evidence. Plumage differences are slight, vocal differences have not been documented, and genetic data are lacking."	
21450	220	"The geographically variable Alaudala rufescens-cheleensis complex is treated as three polytypic species, based on genetics (Ghorbani et al. 2020) and the integrative study of Alström et al. (2021): A. cheleensis; A. rufescens; and A. heinei. Alaudala raytal is also embedded within this complex (Alström et al. 2013)."	
21511	490	Taxon chapini is retained as a subspecies of Sylvietta leucophrys following Fishpool & Collar (2006). The superciliary stripe absent in chapini is also lacking in immature leucophrys and other plumage differences are considered minor. Analysis of vocalizations would be needed to confirm species status.	
21515	489	Taxon leucopsis is retained as a subspecies of Sylvietta brachyura based on inconsistent plumage differences and evidence for dialectal variation in vocalizations; further research is required to determine species limits.	
21551	475	"Taxon pallidior is retained as a subspecies of Neomixis striatigula, as evidence for a split based on vocalizations is considered ambiguous. Detailed bioacoustic and genetic analyses, including in areas of parapatry, are needed."	
21560	482	"Taxon salvadorii is treated as a subspecies of Eremomela icteropygialis, as the evidentiary basis for a split based on minor plumage differences and possible sympatry (Hall 1960) are weak (Dowsett & Dowsett-Lemaire 1993) and salvadorii is purported to intergrade with polioxantha (White 1961)."	
21624	488	"Taxon sousae is retained as a subspecies of Artisornis moreaui, as a split would require additional evidence. Preliminary multilocus DNA data (Fjeldså & Bowie 2021) suggest fairly deep differentiation. However, plumage differences are subtle, vocal data are lacking, and ecological differences between the taxa (Cordeiro et al. 2001) indicate the need for a more detailed comparison."	
21649	492	"The polytypic brevicaudata group is retained in Camaroptera brachyura based on present evidence. Sometimes split based on plumage and habitat differences, the grey-backed brevicaudata group and green-backed brachyura group are vocally similar (Dowsett & Dowsett-Lemaire 1980), and hybridize in areas of contact (White 1962; Zimmerman et al. 2001). Available mitochondrial DNA data (Nguembock et al. 2007) identified deep divergences between brevicaudata, harterti, and brachyura, but further research is needed to define species limits in this group."	
21668	484	"Taxon toroensis is retained as a subspecies of Camaroptera chloronota; the evidentiary basis for a split based on plumage and vocalizations is weak, and marked differences in tail length may prove to be clinal. Further study is needed."	
21715	491	"Taxon flavocincta (polytypic) is retained as a subspecies of Apalis flavida pending further research. Proposed differences in habitat, plumage, and vocalizations are not sufficient to warrant a split in this geographically variable complex; the possibility of intergradation between flavocincta and adjacent forms also requires investigation (Ash & Atkins 2009)."	
21765	1134	"Taxon stronachi is treated as a monotypic species separate from Apalis karamojae based on differences in plumage, vocalizations, and behavior (Nalwanga et al. 2016; Boesman & Collar 2023)."	
21819	486	"Treatment of the Prinia crinigera-P. polychroa complex follows Alström et al. (2020) based on a combined analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, morphology including plumage, and vocalizations. Genomic data may reveal further novel arrangements within this group."	
21833	480	"Taxon khasiana is split from Prinia atrogularis based on obvious differences in plumage, vocalizations, and mitochondrial DNA (Groot 2021)."	
21858	487	"The Prinia gracilis complex is split into two species, P. gracilis and P. lepida, based on Alström et al. (2021a). Mitochondrial DNA and vocalizations support species recognition for P. lepida, corroborated by analysis of plumage, proportions, and size."	
21877	481	"Taxon sonitans is retained as a subspecies of Prinia flaviventris pending further investigation. Although Nilsson (2014) argued to split sonitans based on mitochondrial DNA and vocal differences, patterns of plumage, vocal, and genetic variation in P. flaviventris are complex, and geographic limits poorly defined."	
21927	485	Taxon melanops (polytypic) is retained as a subspecies of Prinia bairdii based on similarities in plumage and vocalizations. Montane melanops is similar in appearance to lowland obscura and the latter hybridizes with bairdii in a narrow contact zone (Prigogine 1979). In the absence of genetic information all three are best considered conspecific.	
21944	477	"Taxon rubehoensis is retained as a subspecies of Scepomycter winifredae, as differences in plumage are subtle and mitochondrial DNA divergences relatively low (Bowie et al. 2009). However, more comprehensive genomic studies are warranted, as nuclear DNA data mostly assorts into two groups corresponding to rubehoensis and winifredae."	
21998	483	"Taxon bailunduensis is treated as a monotypic species separate from Cisticola aberrans (polytypic, including emini) based on vocalizations coupled with morphological and ecological differences (del Hoyo & Collar 2016)."	
22047	476	"Taxon distinctus is treated as a monotypic species separate from Cisticola lais on the basis of divergence in mitochondrial DNA, with distinctus recovered as sister to C. subruficapilla (Davies 2014). Apparent differences in plumage, song, and habitat have been reported, but the two taxa are very similar in plumage and reports of vocal differences are conflicting (Dowsett & Dowsett-Lemaire 1993; Zimmerman et al. 2001; Stevenson & Fanshawe 2020); further research needed to confirm this split."	
22209	340	"Taxon longicaudata (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Nesillas typica (polytypic) based on available evidence. Vocalizations appear poorly differentiated (Louette et al. 1988), rectrix number is variable within typica and moheliensis (Louette et al. 1988), and mitochondrial DNA data (Fuchs et al. 2016) indicate recent separation of longicaudata. Further research, including genomic data, warranted."	
22244	339	"Taxon bensoni (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Calamonastides gracilirostris pending further research. Differences in size, plumage color, iris color, and vocalizations have been documented (Maclean et al. 2003) but these may reflect geographical and dialectical variation; formal bioacoustic and genetic analyses required."	
22265	338	"Taxon baeticatus (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Acrocephalus scirpaceus (polytypic) based on relatively low differentiation in vocalizations (Dowsett-Lemaire & Dowsett 1987), morphology, and genetics (Olsson et al. 2016; Pavia et al. 2018) across the geographic range of this complex. Furthermore, mitochondrial DNA data (Olsson et al. 2016) do not provide strong support for a two-species treatment; further research warranted."	
22299	337	"Taxa from the Philippines (harterti) and Indonesia (celebensis, siebersi, and lentecaptus) are provisionally placed in Acrocephalus stentoreus based on genetic evidence. Limited mitochondrial DNA data (Helbig & Seibold 1999) confirm harterti as a member of the continental A. stentoreus clade, but data for the remaining taxa are lacking; a more comprehensive genetic review is needed to confirm species limits in A. stentoreus and A. australis."	
22364	493	Taxon tenebrosa is transferred from Xanthomixis to Crossleyia (polytypic) following the comprehensive genomic study of Younger et al. (2019).	
22432	327	"Locustella castanea sensu lato is split into three species based on morphology, vocalizations, and genetics: L. castanea (including everetti); monotypic L. musculus; and monotypic L. disturbans. Mitogenomic data (Rheindt et al. 2020) show all members of this complex, including L. portenta, are sufficiently diverged to be treated as species."	
22437	326	Locustella portenta is a newly described monotypic species. Differs in plumage and vocalizations from other members of the broader castanea complex; recovered as the sister lineage to L. disturbans based on mitogenomic data (Rheindt et al. 2020).	
22449	325	"Taxon idonea is split from Locustella mandelli based on plumage, vocalizations and genetics following Alström et al. (2015a)."	
22495	328	"Taxon chadensis is treated as a subspecies of Bradypterus baboecala based on vocalizations; the songs of B. baboecala, including chadensis, are low-pitched and distinguishable from the high-pitched songs of B. centralis (Dowsett-Lemaire 2022). Conflicts between mitochondrial DNA (Alström et al. 2018a) and vocal data (Dowsett-Lemaire 2022) suggest that species limits within the B. baboecala and B. centralis complexes are in need of a comprehensive review."	
22517	329	"Taxon caudatus (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Poodytes punctatus (polytypic) pending further research. Distinguishable on size and plumage from New Zealand P. punctatus, and moderately diverged from P. p. vealeae based on mitochondrial DNA (Alström et al. 2018a), but other taxa have not been sampled. Information on vocalizations and a more comprehensive genetic review are required."	
22529	330	"Megalurulus is synonymized with Cincloramphus based on Alström et al. (2018a); phylogenetic analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA showed that Megalurulus is not monophyletic, and that all species are embedded within Cincloramphus."	
22552	331	Taxon turipavae is split from Cincloramphus whitneyi based on differences in morphology and plumage. The disjunct biogeographic distribution of these taxa also argues for species recognition.	
22554	N-56	"Use of ""mariae"" is the correct original spelling. The spelling ""mariei"" is an unjustified emendation. The original describer was within his right to Latinize the name ""Marie"" into ""Maria"" and form the genitive ""mariae""."	
22561	345	Taxon mutica (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Pnoepyga albiventer based on available genetic and vocal evidence. Analysis of songs and mitochondrial-dominated DNA data from widely separated populations revealed modest levels of divergence that are more consistent with subspecific differentiation (Päckert et al. 2013). Further research on geographical variation in vocalizations and a more comprehensive genetic review is warranted.	
22577	1045	Taxon sirintarae is placed in the genus Pseudochelidon based on morphological similarities (Zusi 1978) and modest divergence in mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Sheldon et al. 2005). Sometimes placed in the monotypic genus Eurochelidon based on bill shape and size (Brooke 1972) but this is herein considered insufficient evidence for generic separation.	
22611	1024	"Taxon brazzae is placed in the monospecific genus Phedinopsis based on differences in ecology, behavior, and vocalizations (e.g., Mills & Cohen 2007), and genetics. Formerly placed in Phedina, both mitochondrial DNA (Sheldon et al. 2005) and genomic data (Brown 2019) recovered brazzae as a deeply diverged lineage."	
22635	993	"Taxon cowani is treated as a monotypic species separate from Riparia paludicola based on a relatively deep genomic DNA divergence (Brown 2019), supported by plumage and vocalizations. However, a comprehensive review of morphological, vocal, and genetic variation across the R. paludicola complex would be informative."	
22648	N-64	"Hirundo leucopyga Meyen, 1834 is the oldest available name for Chilean Swallow, and should therefore be used (now in the new combination Tachycineta leucopyga). Assertions that it is a junior synonym of Hirundo leucopyga Lichtenstein are mistaken, as the latter name has never officially been published beyond its use on museum labels, and is therefore a nomen nudum. Additional assertions that it is junior to Hirundo leucopyga Pallas, 1811 have been invalidated by Mlíkovsk_ & Frahnert (2009). The latter authors showed that Pallas (1811), whose work was entirely in Latin, did not describe Hirundo leucopyga as a new species of swift, but that he merely used the word ""leucopyga"" to talk about a variety of ""white-rumped"" swift that he explicitly refused to recognize at the species level."	
22681	1040	"Taxon ridgwayi (polytypic, including stuarti) is treated as conspecific with Stelgidopteryx serripennis based on available evidence. Divergence in plumage, mitochondrial DNA (Babin 2005) and genomic data (Brown 2019) is modest, apparent vocal differences (Boesman 2016g) have not been quantitatively analyzed, and evidence for sympatry is equivocal. Further research will be needed to determine if species status is warranted."

22775	1044	"The generic attribution Atronanus is recognized for taxon fuliginosus based on genetic evidence, and pending action by the ICZN as it remains a nomen nudum. Formerly placed in Petrochelidon, but mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (de Silva et al. 2018) indicate that the genus is paraphyletic, with fuliginosus more closely aligned with the genus Delichon."	
22805	1043	"Five species are recognized in the Cecropis daurica complex based on a combination of plumage, vocalizations, and evidence from mitochondrial (Sheldon et al. 2005) and genomic DNA data (Brown 2019; Schield et al. 2024): monotypic C. hyperythra based on plumage and vocalizations; monotypic C. badia based on plumage, size, and parapatry with populations of daurica; polytypic C. daurica involving a merger of most populations of temperate-migratory daurica and tropical Asian striolata based on clinality in plumage and genetic paraphyly; monotypic C. rufula based on plumage, genetics, and a zone of parapatry with populations of C. daurica; and polytypic C. melanocrissus based on plumage and genetics. A comprehensive review of this complex integrating formal bioacoustic analyses, broad genomic sampling, and phenotypic variation, is desirable."

Hylia and Pholidornis were recovered as sister genera, and are deeply diverged from related clades (Aegithalidae, Erythrocercidae, and Cettiidae)."	
22902	552	Taxon exilis is placed in the genus Aegithalos based on Johansson et al. (2016) with nuclear and mitochondrial DNA data showing that exilis is embedded within the A. concinnus species complex. A comprehensive genomic review of the entire complex is required.	
22903	550	"Taxa iredalei (polytypic, including rubricapillus) and annamensis (monotypic) are treated as conspecific with Aegithalos concinnus pending further research. Sometimes treated as separate species based on plumage and vocalizations, deep mitochondrial DNA divergences and paraphyly with A. exilis (Johansson et al. 2016) also indicate the presence of multiple species (Päckert et al. 2010; Dai et al. 2011; Dai et al. 2013). However, as not all relevant taxa have been studied, and extensive gene flow has been documented between some taxa (Dai et al. 2017), a taxonomic revision of this complex is deferred pending completion of a comprehensive genome-wide analysis."	
22912	551	"Taxa bonvaloti (polytypic, including obscuratus) and sharpei (monotypic) are treated as conspecific with Aegithalos iouschistos based on similarities in plumage and limited divergence in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (Päckert et al. 2010; Johansson et al. 2016)."

22940	321	"Taxon neumanni (monotypic) and taxon pallidipes (polytypic) are placed together in the genus Hemitesia based on deep genetic divergence from Urosphena sensu stricto in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, and vocalizations which are clearly separable from the latter (Alström et al. 2011)."	
23048	322	"Taxon vulcanius is treated as conspecific with Horornis flavolivaceus pending further research. Sometimes treated as separate species, their circumscription differs among authors, and results from genetic studies using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA are inconsistent (Olsson et al. 2006; Alström et al. 2011); genomic data and bioacoustic analyses are needed."	
23092	316	"Taxon occisinensis (monotypic) is treated as conspecific with Phylloscopus affinis based on genetic evidence. A lack of genomic differentiation (Zhang et al. 2019) accompanied by deep mitochondrial DNA divergences (Martens et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2019) is likely due to past mitochondrial DNA introgression from an extinct species. In addition, plumage, morphological, and vocal differences are considered slight, or to vary clinally."	
23116	315	"Taxon tristis is treated as a subspecies of Phylloscopus collybita based on available evidence. Sometimes split based on differences in plumage, vocalizations, and migratory strategy; however, mitochondrial and genomic DNA data (Marova et al. 2017; Shipilina et al. 2017) indicate the presence of a broad hybrid zone between tristis and P. c. abietinus."	
23197	320	"Taxon sumatrensis (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Phylloscopus grammiceps based on vocal and genetic data. Sometimes considered to be separate species based on call notes and plumage differences, the songs of sumatrensis and grammiceps are indistinguishable (Eaton et al. 2016, 2021) and mitochondrial DNA divergence is low (Alström et al. 2018b). More extensive genomic and bioacoustic research on the P. grammiceps-montis-castaniceps complex is required."	
23237	317	Taxon nigrorum (polytypic) is split from Phylloscopus trivirgatus (polytypic) based on plumage and genetics. Mitochondrial-dominated data consistently identify the Philippine group (nigrorum) as distinct from the trivirgatus group (Olsson et al. 2005; Jones & Kennedy 2008; Shakya et al. 2018); deep divergences among clades within nigrorum (Campbell et al. 2016) indicate that a more comprehensive review of this complex is warranted.	
23242	435	"Taxon floresianus is treated as a subspecies of Phylloscopus presbytes based on overall similarities in plumage and vocalizations (Ng et al. 2018), accompanied by moderate mitochondrial DNA divergence (Reeve et al. 2023b). However, this creates an unusual biogeographic linkage, and further study is required."

A more comprehensive genetic review is warranted."	
23258	319	"Taxon makirensis is treated as a monotypic species separate from Phylloscopus poliocephalus (polytypic); however, the entire Island Leaf Warbler complex is in need of a comprehensive taxonomic revision based on bioacoustic, morphological, and genomic analyses."

23305	1012	"Taxon kakamegae (polytypic, including kungwensis) is treated as conspecific with Arizelocichla masukuensis based on available evidence. Plumage differences are slight and vocal differences are poorly documented. Although divergence in mitochondrial DNA is evident (Shakya & Sheldon 2017; De Santis et al. 2018), further research with broader geographic and genetic sampling is needed."	
23313	1013	"Taxon kikuyuensis is treated as a species separate from Arizelocichla nigriceps based on plumage, vocalizations, and genetics. Although plumage differences are obvious, information from mitochondrial DNA (Shakya & Sheldon 2017; De Santis et al. 2018) is restricted to short fragments, and formal bioacoustic analyses are lacking; further research would be informative."	
23319	1015	"Taxon striifacies (polytypic, including olivaceiceps) is treated as a species separate from Arizelocichla milanjensis based on available evidence. Sometimes split into 3 species (A. milanjensis, A. striifacies and A. olivaceiceps) but plumage differences support a 2-species treatment with milanjensis, the most distinctive taxon, separated at the species level. Genetic data are fragmentary but mitochondrial DNA (Shakya & Sheldon 2017) supports separation of striifacies from milanjensis. Nevertheless, a comprehensive genetic study and investigation of contact zones is needed to confirm species limits in this group."	
23329	1011	"Taxon flavigula (polytypic, including soror) is treated as a species separate from Atimastillas flavicollis based on plumage and vocalizations. Although plumages are geographically variable they show an abrupt transition, with an apparent lack of intergradation, where their ranges approach. Available genetic data are fragmentary (Moyle & Marks 2006; Johansson et al. 2007; Fregin et al. 2012a) and comparative data lacking; further research needed."

Sometimes treated as separate species based on morphology (Dowsett 1972), taxon sucosus has been shown to be intermediate in size between the two (Dowsett-Lemaire 1990; Dowsett & Dowsett-Lemaire 1993), and they lack significant vocal, behavioral, and ecological differences. Genetic data are fragmentary (Johansson et al. 2007; De Santis et al. 2018), and largely uninformative; further research needed."

((N-65: The correct species epithet for Black-headed Bulbul is Brachypodius melanocephalos, first published as Lanius melanocephalos Gmelin, 1788. The usage of the name Brachypodius atriceps, based on Turdus atriceps Temminck, 1822, is based on the belief that Brachypodius melanocephalos (Gmelin, 1788) is a junior synonym of Lanius collurio, var. _ melanocephalus Gmelin, 1788 (a name of a subspecies of Red-backed Shrike). However, the latter two names differ by one letter (ICZN Article 57.6), and are therefore not homonyms. Even if they were to be considered homonyms, the name for the bulbul would take precedence because of its higher rank in the original work by Gmelin (1788) (ICZN Article 24.1)."

23444	761c	"The eight members of Rubigula, previously included in an expanded Pycnonotus, are separated generically based on the genetic analysis of Shakya & Sheldon (2017). Retaining these in a broad Pycnonotus would render the genus paraphyletic, as Spizixos is embedded within it."	
23462	N-42	"Rubigula melanicterus has also been used. Gmelin (1789) originally described the species as ""melanictera"" under the genus Muscicapa. The word is of Greek origin and Latinized, and is not an obvious choice for an adjective because the decisive part ""-ictera"" is a Latinization of the Greek noun ""ikteros"", referring to a classical yellow bird (probably the European Oriole). An obvious adjectivization of this would have been ""-icterinus / -icterina"". Hence, the word should be interpreted as a noun in apposition. Even if this argument is not granted, Article 31.2.2 of the Code would stipulate an interpretation as a noun rather than an adjective in cases of doubt. Hence, the original ""melanictera"" should be used regardless of genus context."

Although available genetic evidence does not provide strong support for its exact placement (Shakya & Sheldon 2017), leucogrammicus was originally placed in Ixos based on morphology and is the treatment followed here.

23557	N-53	"The spelling leucogenys is the original spelling used under a plate caption. Unfortunately, the index of this work lists the name under a different spelling (leucogenis). However, doubts about the correct original spelling can be laid to rest as the same author later published information on the same species under the name ""leucogenys"", acting as a First Reviser. That latter spelling is herein adopted."

Sometimes split into four species (P. barbatus, P. somaliensis, P. dodsoni, and P. tricolor); however, plumage differences are minor, intermediate phenotypes and potential hybrids have been reported (e.g., Turner & Pearson 2015), and vocal differences appear negligible. Although ad hoc mitochondrial DNA data are available for some taxa (Sorenson & Payne 2001; Moyle & Marks 2006; Fuchs et al. 2009, 2018c; Dejtaradol et al. 2016; Huntley & Voelker 2016) a comprehensive genetic review of this complex is lacking; further research needed."

23693	756	"Taxon catarmanensis is treated as a monotypic species separate from Hypsipetes everetti based on differences in vocalizations, plumage, and size, supported by mitochondrial DNA data (Oliveros & Moyle 2010). Although H. e. haynaldi is sometimes treated as specifically distinct based on differences in plumage and size, further research is needed before implementing this split, including analyses of newly available recordings."

23896	343	"A broad Paradoxornis is recognized following Cai et al. (2019). Sometimes split into multiple small genera based on morphology (Penhallurick & Robson 2009) or genetics (Yeung et al. 2011), a phylogenetic analysis of multiple nuclear and mitochondrial DNA loci (Cai et al. 2019) identified two well-resolved clades within the Paradoxornithidae: Paradoxornis and Suthora."

The epithet rufipectus must be considered a noun for two reasons: (1) ""pectus"" = breast is a noun in Latin. There is a conventional way to form an adjective of this noun: ""pectoralis"". If Salvadori had had an adjective in mind, he could have named the species ""rufipectoralis"", an epithet that has been coined for other bird species (e.g., Ochthoeca rufipectoralis).

Although plumage differences are present, mitochondrial DNA divergence is low (Cibois et al. 2018b), vocal differences have not been formally analysed, and results from a genomic DNA study are pending."	
25037	566	"Taxon somervillei (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Argya striata (polytypic) based on available evidence. Although somervillei is separable on plumage, vocalizations are similar, and formal bioacoustic and genetic data are lacking. Possibly parapatric; further research required."	
25054	565	"Taxon huttoni (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Argya caudata (polytypic) based on differences in plumage and tail length (Rasmussen & Anderton 2012). Although vocal differences have also been reported (Rasmussen & Anderton 2012) formal bioacoustic analyses are lacking, and genetic data is uninformative (Cibois et al. 2018b; Cai et al. 2019)."	
25073	569	"Kupeornis (polyspecific) is synonymised with Turdoides as this treatment results in sister clades of similar age (i.e., Turdoides and Argya) (Moyle et al. 2012; Cibois et al. 2018b; Cai et al. 2019)."	
25074	567	"Taxon nipalensis is placed in the genus Turdoides (Turdoides nipalensis), as suggested by Moyle et al. (2012), Cibois et al. (2018b), and Cai et al. (2019), based on multilocus genetic data."	
25075	568	"The monotypic taxa rubiginosus, bohndorffi, and atripennis, are treated as conspecific and placed in the genus Turdoides. Although separable based on differences in size and plumage, additional information is needed to support a split."	
25180	571	Taxon cinereiceps (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Ianthocincla cineracea (polytypic) based on available evidence. Mitochondrial DNA divergence is low (Luo et al. 2009; Moyle et al. 2012) and plumage differences are more consistent with subspecies-level differences.	
25211	570	"Taxon monachus (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Pterorhinus chinensis (polytypic) based on available evidence. Although monachus differs in size and plumage, mitochondrial divergence is low (Wu et al. 2012; Cibois et al. 2018b) and monophyly of P. chinensis sensu stricto is not supported by the available data (Cibois et al. 2018b). A more comprehensive morphological and genetic review of this complex is needed."	
25284	241	Taxon bonthaina (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Hylocitrea bonensis pending further research. The two forms differ in plumage but more detailed analyses of geographic variation and genetic divergence are required.	
25299	324	"Taxon calendula is placed in the monospecific genus Corthylio based on pronounced differences in vocalizations (Päckert et al. 2003, 2009) and morphology from the species in Regulus, and the deep divergence revealed by mitochondrial DNA (Päckert et al. 2003, 2009) and genomic data (Oliveros et al. 2019)."	
25333	1180a	Tichodroma is placed in the monotypic family Tichodromidae based on genomic (Oliveros et al. 2019) and multilocus DNA data (Imfeld et al. 2024) that consistently place it as sister to both Sittidae and Certhiidae.	
25402	704	Taxon arctica is treated as a monotypic species separate from Sitta europaea based on genetics (Zink et al. 2006; Päckert et al. 2020) and morphology (Red’kin & Konovalova 2006). Both mitochondrial DNA and multilocus datasets show arctica to be basal to the major Eurasian and Sino-Himalayan clades of nuthatches.	
25439	1180b	"Salpornis is placed in the monotypic family Salpornithidae based on genomic (Oliveros et al. 2019) and multilocus DNA data (Imfeld et al. 2024). Although recovered as sister to Certhiidae, with which it shares behavioral similarities, the divergence is deeper than between other recognized families in Certhiodea."	
25516	1167	"Taxon sticturus (polytypic, including obscurus) is treated as a species separate from Ramphocaenus melanurus based primarily on vocalizations and local sympatry (Harvey et al. 2014), supported by divergence in mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Smith et al. 2018)."	
25534	1158	"Three species are recognized in the Polioptila guianensis complex based on vocalizations and genetics: monotypic P. guianensis; monotypic P. clementsi; and polytypic P. paraensis (including facilis and attenboroughi). Sometimes split into 5 species based on the multilocus DNA data of Smith et al. (2018), however, vocal similarities and lower DNA divergence support retaining paraensis, facilis, and attenboroughi as a single species."	
25547	1157	"Three species are recognized in the Polioptila plumbea complex based on genetic (Smith et al. 2018) and vocal (Boesman 2016h) evidence: P. plumbea (polytypic, including parvirostris, atricapilla, innotata, plumbiceps, and anteocularis); P. maior (monotypic); and P. bilineata (polytypic, including brodkorbi, superciliaris, cinericia, and daguae). However, phylogenetic information based on multilocus and mitochondrial DNA data (Smith et al. 2018) indicate that P. plumbea sensu stricto is not monophyletic and further research, including genomic data and an in-depth analysis of vocalizations, will be needed to better define species limits in this group."	
25555	1156	"Taxon albiventris is treated as a monotypic species separate from Polioptila albiloris based on deep divergence and paraphyly in mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Smith et al. 2018), supported by vocalizations. Although P. albiventris is recovered as sister to P. bilineata it also differs from this group in plumage, ecology, and apparently vocalizations."	
25628	1152	"Taxon albinucha is treated as a subspecies of Thryothorus ludovicianus based on subtle differences in plumage and vocalizations, and relatively shallow mitochondrial DNA divergence (Mann et al. 2006; Imfeld et al. 2024). Formal analysis of vocalizations might be informative."	
25672	1150	"Taxa capistratus (polytypic) and humilis (monotypic) are treated as species separate from Campylorhynchus rufinucha based on differences in vocalizations (Sosa-López et al. 2013; Boesman 2016j; Ku-Peralta et al. 2020) combined with evidence from mitochondrial DNA and morphology (Vázquez-Miranda et al. 2009). Furthermore, the hybrid zone between C. capistratus and C. humilis, detailed by Selander (1964), is drastically reduced in extent or no longer exists (Vázquez-Miranda et al. 2009)."	
25755	1149	"Seven species are recognized within the Troglodytes aedon complex based on various combinations of genetic (Klicka et al. 2023a), vocal (Sosa-López & Mennill 2014; Sosa-López et al. 2016; Boesman 2016i), morphological (Oberholser 1904; Wetten 2021), and ecological data: T. aedon (polytypic, including brunneicollis, cahooni, and parkmanii); T. beani (monotypic); T. martinicensis (polytypic, including guadeloupensis and rufescens); T. mesoleucus (monotypic); T. musicus (monotypic); T. grenadensis (monotypic); and T. musculus (polytypic, all remaining subspecies). The major split between T. aedon and T. musculus is strongly supported by genomic data (Klicka et al. 2023a); recognition of T. beani is based on its distinctive morphology and vocalizations despite being embedded within the musculus group on mitochondrial DNA and genomic data; elevation of the remaining island taxa is based mostly on assessment of plumage, vocalizations, and habitat preferences, despite retaining genetic affinities with T. musculus from the mainland."	
25880	1151	"Taxon schulenbergi is treated as a monotypic species separate from Pheugopedius euophrys based on differences in vocalizations (Boesman 2016k), supported by modest plumage differences."	
25925	1153	"Taxa paucimaculatus and columbianus are treated as subspecies of Pheugopedius sclateri based on minor plumage and call differences, combined with intra-taxon variability in songs. Further research incorporating genetic data will be needed to determine species limits in this complex."	
25954	1155	"Taxon elutus is treated as a monotypic species separate from Cantorchilus modestus based on deep mitochondrial DNA divergence and apparent paraphyly, supported by subtle plumage differences (Saucier et al. 2015). Information on vocal differences is conflicting (Mann et al. 2003; Saucier et al. 2015; Boesman 2016l); however, songs of Cantorchilus wrens are complex and should be the subject of a detailed multi-parameter analysis."	
26023	1154	Taxon dichrous is treated as a monotypic species separate from Cyphorhinus thoracicus based on consistent differences in vocalizations (Boesman 2016ccc).	
26065	N-26	"The original spelling was Tanagra erythroryncha, but the species was soon moved into the genus Buphagus, and many modern sources have emended the original spelling to ""erythrorhynchus"" (with an -rh). In 2023, by some measures, the usage of the -rh spelling was roughly an order of magnitude higher than the usage of the original -r spelling, but by other measures, it was only ~4 times higher, which is not considered as a prevailing usage by most practitioners, hence arguing in favor of the retention of the original -r spelling. Additionally, erythroryncha is not an adjective but a poorly formed noun, and its ending can therefore not be adjusted according to the gender of the genus. Therefore, the original spelling ""erythroryncha"" is retained."	
26080	1206	"Taxon sanctaeluciae is treated as a monotypic species separate from Ramphocinclus brachyurus based on deep genomic divergence (DaCosta et al. 2019), supported by minor plumage, structural, and vocal differences."	
26193	143	Taxon rabori is treated as a monotypic species separate from Rhabdornis inornatus (polytypic) based on morphology (Collar 2011); genetic data would be informative.	
26203	144	"Taxon miranda is placed in the monospecific genus Goodfellowia. Sometimes included in Basilornis, but mitochondrial DNA (Lovette & Rubenstein 2007) did not recover the genus as monophyletic, instead placing miranda as sister to Sarcops and Streptocitta."	
26228	"145, 146, 149"	145)) Taxon enganensis (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Gracula religiosa (polytypic) based on vocalizations and genetics. Mitochondrial DNA divergence between enganensis and mainland religiosa is low (Jarulis et al. 2021) in agreement with their near-identical voice. 146)) Taxon venerata (monotypic) is treated as a species separate from Gracula religiosa (polytypic) based on differences in vocalizations and structure of the wattle (Eaton et al. 2021). 149)) Taxon robusta (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Gracula religiosa based on Ng et al. (2021). Genomic data show that robusta is embedded in a clade that also includes subspecies batuensis and miotera and should not be split.	
26238	146	Taxon venerata is treated as a monotypic species separate from Gracula religiosa (polytypic) based on differences in vocalizations and structure of the wattle (Eaton et al. 2021).	
26241	147	Taxon circumscripta (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Aplonis metallica (polytypic) based on available evidence. Plumage and morphological differences seem more consistent with subspecies status; genetic data would be informative.	
26344	137	"Gracupica contra sensu lato is treated as three species based on assessment of bare parts color and genetics (Baveja et al. 2021): G. contra (polytypic, including superciliaris); G. floweri (monotypic); and G. jalla (monotypic). Further research including a formal analysis of phenotypic variation, and interactions along the contact zone between floweri and contra, would be informative."	
26360	138	Taxon blythii (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Sturnia malabarica (polytypic) based on available evidence. Mitochondrial DNA divergence is small (Zuccon et al. 2008) and it is unclear if phenotypic differences reflect clinal variation or ecomorphological patterns; further research on species limits in this complex is needed.	
26380	139	Taxon leucocephalus is treated as a monotypic species separate from Acridotheres burmannicus based on morphometric differences; plumage differences are modest and no genetic data are available for leucocephalus.	
26407	150	"Taxon neumanni (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Onychognathus morio (polytypic) pending further research. Although bill shape and narial feathering of morio are distinct, vocalizations are similar to neumanni; further research is needed to affirm this split."	
26444	140	"Taxon sharpii is placed in the monospecific genus Pholia and taxon femoralis is placed in a monospecific Arizelopsar based on morphology and genetics. Sometimes placed in Poeoptera, but mitochondrial DNA divergences among these three genera are relatively deep (Lovette & Rubenstein 2007)."	
26462	142	"Taxa violacior (monotypic) and benguelensis (monotypic) are treated as subspecies of Lamprotornis mevesii based on available evidence. Current data indicate that plumages are variable, distributions more continuous, and patterns of habitat use overlapping."	
26466	141	"Taxon elisabeth (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Lamprotornis chloropterus based on available evidence. Distributions appear continuous and vocalizations are similar, the taxa differing only in the belly color of juveniles; genetic data for elisabeth are lacking."	
26593	64	"Taxon woahensis is treated as a species separate from Myadestes lanaiensis based on available evidence. Sometimes considered conspecific (Olson 1996), but the justification for lumping them is considered premature based on biogeographic considerations, and pending the outcome of genetic work in progress."	
26611	104	"The Zoothera dauma sensu lato complex is treated as five species based on a combination of morphology, vocalizations (Weir 2018), and biogeography: Z. dauma (polytypic, including iriomotensis and horsfieldi); Z. aurea (polytypic, including toratugumi); Z. neilgherriensis; Z. imbricata; and Z. major. Analyses of fragmentary genetic data (Klicka et al. 2005; Sangster et al. 2010; Price et al. 2014; Robin et al. 2015) indicate the presence of multiple species within this complex but a more comprehensive review including all taxa is required."	
26628	102	"Taxon atrigena is treated as a species separate from Zoothera talaseae based on differences in plumage, bare parts color, and morphology. Genetic and vocal data would be desirable."	
26650	99	"Taxa chubbi, peruviana, and gularis are treated as conspecific with Cichlopsis leucogenys based on available evidence. Although multiple species are considered likely, plumage differences are minor, and comprehensive vocal and genetic data are lacking; further research is needed to determine species limits in this complex."	
26697	101	"Taxon swainsoni is treated as conspecific with Catharus ustulatus based on available evidence. Although genetically diagnosable across a range of genomic and mitochondrial DNA regions (Ruegg & Smith 2002; Ruegg et al. 2014; Delmore et al. 2015; Bay & Ruegg 2017), mitochondrial DNA divergence is low (Ruegg & Smith 2002), and mitochondrial DNA introgression is widespread along their contact zone (Ruegg 2008). Combined with relatively low morphological and vocal divergence, presence of intermediate phenotypes across a hybrid zone (Ruegg 2008), and suggestions of a hybrid swarm in Alaska, they are best treated as conspecific pending further research."	
26802	91	"Taxon mupinensis (monotypic) is placed in the genus Turdus based on available evidence. Sometimes placed in the monospecific genus Otocichla, mitochondrial-dominated DNA data do not provide unambiguous support for this arrangement (Nylander et al. 2008; Batista et al. 2020), and genomic data for mupinensis is lacking (Batista et al. 2020); further research desirable."

Although mitochondrial DNA recovered anthracinus and conradi as sister lineages (Batista et al. 2020), nominate chiguanco was not sampled, while genomic data suggest that representatives of T. fuscater are embedded within T. chiguanco and T. olivater (Batista et al. 2020); further research is needed to determine species limits in the broader chiguanco-fuscater-olivater complex."	
27036	95	"Taxon subalaris is treated as a species separate from Turdus nigriceps based on plumage, vocalizations, and genetics. Mitochondrial DNA divergence between these species is deep, and they do not form a monophyletic clade (Cerqueira et al. 2016; Batista et al. 2020)."

A genetic analysis dominated by mitochondrial DNA data places E. l. suahelicus as a divergent sister lineage to E. ardens (Prager et al. 2008) in support of this treatment; as nominate E. laticauda was not included in the analysis, further genetic work is desirable."	
29165	504	Taxon jubaensis is treated as a monotypic species separate from Anaplectes rubriceps (polytypic) based on plumage differences. Taxon leuconotos is retained as a subspecies of A. rubriceps based on plumage similarities and the presence of a broad zone of hybridization between them.	
29222	557	"The genus recommendations proposed by Olsson & Alström (2020) are accepted, with the exception that Bathilda ruficauda and Aidemosyne modesta are placed in the genus Emblema, along with E. pictum. Multilocus genetic data (Olsson & Alström 2020), as well as plumage and ecological similarities, unite these three species."	
29235	561	"Taxon evangelinae (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Neochmia phaeton based on available evidence. Although differences in plumage, bill coloration, and tail length exist, additional data from vocalizations and genetics are needed."	
29249	N-54	"Use of ""bichenovii"" is the correct original spelling; ""bichenoii"" is an unjustified emendation."	
29253	562	"Taxon castanotis (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Taeniopygia guttata based on modest differences in plumage, size, vocalizations (Clayton 1990a), and genetics that encompasses both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA data (Balakrishnan & Edwards 2009; Newhouse & Balakrishnan 2015; Olsson & Alström 2020). Although assortative mating has been observed in captivity (e.g., Clayton 1990b), it could have occurred in response to external factors (Burley et al. 1982), or the evolution of local song dialects (Wang et al. 2022), and is not considered evidence of species status."	
29272	559	Taxon nigriceps (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Spermestes bicolor (polytypic) based on available evidence. Reports of parapatry have not been confirmed and genetic data are limited (Arnaiz-Villena et al. 2009; Olsson & Alström 2020); further research needed.	
29361	560	"Taxon nigerrima is treated as a monotypic species separate from Lonchura hunsteini based on available evidence. Genomic data demonstrate that this group has radiated recently and rapidly (Stryjewski & Sorenson 2017) and may represent a hybrid swarm. Based on detectable but weak genomic divergence, combined with evidence of geographic replacement amongst other species in this complex, it seems most likely that L. nigerrima is also specifically distinct. However, no data on vocalizations, biometrics, or ecology exist to support this split; further research needed."	
29391	563	"Taxa regia, efatensis, and serena, sometimes recognized as a polytypic species Erythrura regia, are considered conspecific with E. cyaneovirens based on relatively subtle plumage differences. Genome-wide SNP data indicate that E. cyaneovirens, as currently defined, is not monophyletic (DeCicco et al. 2023), with E. pealii sister to taxon regia with strong branch support. In addition, there is considerable mitochondrial divergence between regia and cyaneovirens at ~3.6% based on the ND2 gene, but E. pealii was not included in this analysis. A future comprehensive reassessment is likely to lead to a division of E. cyaneovirens as currently constituted."	
29476	N-55	"The original spelling was printed with a ligature that has elicited controversy over whether it should be interpreted as an -oe or an -ae. However, the spelling ""caerulescens"" is currently in clearly prevailing usage, and is therefore here adopted."	
29495	558	"Taxon ochrogaster (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Estrilda paludicola (polytypic) based on available evidence. Although ochrogaster differs from nominate in plumage, tail length, and voice, differences from other taxa are less clear. Further research, including genetic data, is needed, as multiple species may be present."	
29627	556	"Taxa vinacea (monotypic) and nigricollis (monotypic) are treated as subspecies of Lagonosticta larvata pending further research. Sometimes split into three species based on plumage, but bioacoustic and genetic data are lacking, and intermediates have been reported (Payne 2004)."	
29631	555	"Taxon landanae (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Lagonosticta rubricata (polytypic), as it is only known to differ in bill color and size (Payne 2004)."	
29664	243	Taxon fagani (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Prunella ocularis following Kirwan et al. (2021); plumage differences are minor and mitochondrial DNA divergence is weak (Drovetski et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2017).	
29701	702	"The genus Montifringilla is split into three genera based on multilocus genetic data (Qu et al. 2006; Päckert et al. 2021), and supported by morphology: polytypic Montifringilla (M. adamsi, M. nivalis and M. henrici); monotypic Onychostruthus (O. taczanowskii); and polytypic Pyrgilauda (P. davidiana, P. ruficollis, P. blanfordi, and P. theresae). Further research needed as basal relationships remain poorly resolved (Qu et al. 2006; Päckert et al. 2021), mitochondrial DNA data do not recover davidiana and blanfordi as monophyletic groups (Resano-Mayor et al. 2017; Päckert et al. 2021), and cryptic taxonomic diversity may be present (Gebauer et al. 2006; Resano-Mayor et al. 2017; Päckert et al. 2021)."	
29825	549	"Taxon ruficollis is transferred from Madanga to Anthus (Anthus ruficollis) based on analysis of multilocus DNA data and morphology (Alström et al. 2015b), while taxon bocagii is transferred from Amaurocichla to Motacilla (as Motacilla bocagii) based on multilocus DNA (Alström et al. 2015b) and genome-wide (Harris et al. 2018b) genetic evidence. For reasons of taxonomic stability, taxon chloris is placed in Hemimacronyx pending further research. Mitochondrial-dominated DNA data suggest that chloris is closely related to Macronyx croceus and M. capensis (Pietersen et al. 2019), which are embedded within Anthus. Similarly, taxon sharpei is placed in Macronyx instead of Hemimacronyx, pending further research. A comprehensive genetic review of genera Anthus, Macronyx, Hemimacronyx, and Tmetothylacus is needed."	
29904	547	"Taxon nicholsoni (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Anthus similis based on non-monophyly and deep divergence in mitochondrial DNA data (Finch et al. 2013; Pietersen et al. 2019). Furthermore, the two species are widely separated with the intervening habitat occupied by a related species without intergradation. However, vocalizations appear to be similar or identical and there are no compelling plumage differences. Further study of the whole similis group is desirable."	
29937	546	"Taxon australis (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Anthus novaeseelandiae (polytypic) on the basis of differences in size, wing-tip structure, and plumage as detailed by Schodde & Mason (1999). However, genetic divergence and vocal differences, if any, have yet to be elucidated and further work is needed to confirm this split."	
30003	548	"Taxon brevirostris is treated as a monotypic species separate from Anthus furcatus based on differences in vocalizations, habitat, and genetics (van Els & Norambuena 2018; van Els et al. 2019; Pearman & Areta 2020)."	
30040	1137	"Taxon japonicus is treated as a monotypic species separate from Anthus rubescens based on differences in plumage and bare parts coloration, mitochondrial DNA divergence, and subtle differences in call notes (Doniol-Valcroze et al. 2023). Further research of these two species in their contact zone would be informative."	
30057	712	"Five species are recognized in the Fringilla coelebs complex based on genomic DNA data (Recuerda et al. 2021), in conjunction with differences in plumage, biometrics and vocalizations: F. spodiogenys (polytypic, including africana and harterti); F. moreletti (monotypic); F. maderensis (monotypic); and F. canariensis (polytypic, including palmae, ombriosa and bakeri); and polytypic F. coelebs (all remaining subspecies)."	
30076	1141	"Taxa elegantissima, musica, flavifrons, sclateri, and cyanocephala are placed in Chlorophonia rather than Euphonia based on genetic evidence. Nuclear, multilocus, and genomic DNA data (Zuccon et al. 2012; Imfeld et al. 2020; Vázquez-López et al. 2024) all recovered Euphonia as paraphyletic with respect to Chlorophonia. We recognize an expanded Chlorophonia rather than separating these five species in Cyanophonia as proposed by Imfeld et al. (2020)."	
30113	1135	Taxon godmani is treated as a monotypic species separate from Euphonia affinis based primarily on differences in plumage and mitochondrial DNA divergence comparable to other species pairs in this genus (Vázquez-López et al. 2020). Taxon godmani also appears to differ vocally (Vázquez-López et al. 2020) but samples are insufficient to establish homology or vocal variability within taxa.	
30179	1112	"Taxa vespertina and abeillei are placed in the genus Hesperiphona based, in part, on the genetic data of Zuccon et al. (2012). Sometimes placed in Coccothraustes, nuclear DNA data recovered vespertina as a divergent lineage rendering Coccothraustes paraphyletic (contra mitochondrial DNA data from that study); furthermore, abeillei was not sampled."	
30213	1142	"Taxon grandis is treated as a monotypic species separate from Carpodacus rhodochlamys based on divergence in multilocus DNA data (Tietze et al. 2013), supported by differences in plumage, morphometrics, and vocalizations (Ayé & Schweizer 2006)."	
30218	1143	"Taxon davidianus is treated as a monotypic species separate from Carpodacus pulcherrimus (polytypic, including argyrophrys) based on vocalizations and mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Tietze et al. 2013). Although taxon argyrophrys is placed in C. pulcherrimus based on mitochondrial DNA, it differs in vocalizations; further research would be informative."	
30245	926	"Taxon lepidus (polytypic, including henrici) is treated as conspecific with Carpodacus sibiricus based on available evidence. Liu et al. (2020a) proposed splitting C. lepidus (with henrici) based on relatively modest mitochondrial DNA divergence and subtle plumage differences despite a lack of vocal differentiation. Further research, including genomic DNA data and additional vocal traits, may provide support for this split."	
30326	1140	"Taxon mana is placed in Loxops rather than Manucerthia based on the lack of major phenotypic differences, and relatively shallow mitochondrial and nuclear DNA divergence (Fleischer et al. 2001; Reding et al. 2009; Lerner et al. 2011). The only anomalous character of L. mana is its lack of a tubular tongue, which may be a paedomorphic feature (Olson 2015b)."	
30346	1105	"Taxon waterstradti is treated as a subspecies of Pyrrhula nipalensis based on available evidence. Although widely allopatric, plumage differences are relatively minor, and detailed studies of vocalizations and genetics are lacking; further research needed."	
30366	1104	"Taxon owstoni is treated as a species separate from Pyrrhula erythaca based on differences in male plumage, vocalizations, and multilocus DNA data (Dong et al. 2020). However, vocalizations are highly variable and a formal bioacoustic analysis with dense sampling will be needed to confirm this treatment."	
30369	1103	Taxon alienus is treated as a subspecies of Rhodopechys sanguineus pending further research. Sometimes split as a species based on relatively minor differences in plumage and wing length (Kirwan et al. 2006); analysis of vocalizations and genetics needed.	
30452	919	"Taxon kittlitzi is treated as a subspecies of Chloris sinica based on available evidence. Although considered to be the most distinctive taxon in this complex, mitochondrial DNA divergence is moderate (Saitoh et al. 2020), morphological differences (e.g., bill) are not diagnostic, plumage differences are minor, and vocal data are lacking."	
30535	1139	Taxon whytii is treated as a monotypic species separate from Crithagra striolata based on differences in plumage and divergence in mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Nguembock et al. 2009). Further research would be informative.	
30562	1138	"Taxon striatipectus is treated as a monotypic species separate from Crithagra reichardi based on subtle differences in plumage and behavior, combined with differences in ecology; also reported to differ vocally (Stevenson & Fanshawe 2002). A comprehensive genetic review would be informative."	
30591	1108	"The polytypic Acanthis flammea complex is treated as a single species based on genetic evidence. Although formerly separated into three species (A. flammea, A. hornemanni and A. cabaret), mitochondrial, nuclear, and genomic DNA analyses show a lack of divergence and high levels of gene flow (Marthinsen et al. 2008; Mason & Taylor 2015), with phenotypic variation largely determined by a chromosomal inversion that shows a latitudinal (rather than a taxon-specific) gradient in its distribution (Funk et al. 2021). However, there is evidence of assortative mating where the taxa come into secondary contact, and the three taxa are generally identifiable as discrete phenotypes; further research needed."	
30604	1107	"Taxon sinesciuris is treated as a species separate from Loxia curvirostra based on evidence of assortative mating and near-complete reproductive isolation (Smith & Benkman 2007; Benkman et al. 2009), supported, in part, by genetics. Although sinesciuris forms a separate clade based on analysis of genome-wide data (Parchman et al. 2016), divergence is extremely shallow and renders L. curvirostra paraphyletic; further research needed."	
30626	1106	"Taxon mindanensis is treated as a species separate from Chrysocorythus estherae based on marked differences in plumage (Eaton et al. 2021), although genetic and vocal data are needed to confirm this split."	
30635	1109	"Taxon caniceps (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Carduelis carduelis based on abrupt transitions in plumage and vocalizations. However, mitochondrial DNA divergence (Zamora et al. 2006) is shallow and hybridization occurs in areas of contact; further research incorporating genome-wide DNA analyses would be informative."	
30766	554	Taxon vincenti (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Emberiza capensis based on minor plumage differences forming a stepped cline and absence of vocal differentiation.	
30789	576	"Taxon septemstriata is treated as conspecific with Emberiza tahapisi, although its status as a valid taxon remains unresolved. The single specimen included in the genetic study of Olsson et al. (2013b) had the plumage of tahapisi but the mitochondrial DNA of E. goslingi; further research needed."	
30802	575	"Taxon minor is treated as a subspecies of Emberiza pallasi based on consideration of morphology, and suggestions that song, behaviour, and ecology also align it with pallasi (Shirihai & Svensson 2018). Further research desirable."	
30839	553	Taxon personata (monotypic) is split from Emberiza spodocephala (polytypic) based on mitochondrial DNA divergence (Weißensteiner 2013; Päckert et al. 2015) in combination with diagnostic plumage differences in males (Byers et al. 1995). Analysis of vocalizations would be informative.	
30893	1118	"Taxon quinquestriata (polytypic, including septentrionalis) is placed in the monotypic genus Amphispizopsis based on deep divergence in mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Klicka et al. 2014; Cicero et al. 2020), lack of strong support for A. quinquestriata and Amphispiza bilineata as sister species, and phenotypic differences between these species."	
30936	841	"Taxon hypophaeus is treated as a subspecies of Chlorospingus flavigularis based on available evidence. Although differences in plumage, iris color, and mitochondrial DNA (Weir 2009) are present, additional information from vocalizations and genomic DNA is needed to determine species limits in this group."	
31087	1115	"Taxon nigriceps is treated as a species separate from Arremon abeillei based mostly on plumage, and genomic DNA divergence (Buainain et al. 2022), supported by vocalizations. Plumage differences are commensurate with species status and show an abrupt transition without evidence of intergradation, but a rigorous analysis of vocal differences is lacking."	
31093	1116	"Taxon axillaris is treated as a monotypic species separate from Arremon taciturnus based on genomic DNA divergence (Buainain et al. 2022), bill color, and vocal frequency (Buainain et al. 2017), supported by minor plumage differences. A more comprehensive analysis of phenotypic and vocal variability would be informative."	
31116	1119	"Taxon arborea (polytypic, including ochracea) is placed in the monotypic genus Spizelloides rather than Passerella based on deep mitochondrial DNA divergence (Klicka et al. 2014), the lack of strong support for S. arborea and P. iliaca as sister species, as well as phenotypic differences between these species."	
31121	1125	"The Passerella iliaca complex is treated as a single polytypic species pending publication of current genomic DNA research and updated information on hybrid zone dynamics. Sometimes split into four species based primarily on morphology and mitochondrial DNA data (e.g., Zink 1994; Zink & Weckstein 2003)."	
31234	1126	"The Passerculus sandwichensis complex is treated as a single polytypic species pending publication of current genomic DNA research. Sometimes split into four species based on morphology and mitochondrial DNA data (e.g., Benham & Cheviron 2019); however, divergence of most taxa is modest and not all taxa have been recovered as reciprocally monophyletic."	
31252	1124	"Taxa bairdii (monotypic) and henslowii (polytypic, including susurrans) are placed in the genus Centronyx based on available evidence. Previously included in Ammodramus, however this group was recovered as polyphyletic based on mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Klicka & Spellman 2007; Klicka et al. 2014; Barker et al. 2015). Although bairdii and henslowii were recovered as sister taxa (albeit with weak support) their phylogenetic affinities remain poorly resolved. This precludes their transfer to a sister genus (e.g., Passerculus) pending further research, while recognition of a broad Passerculus (subsuming Centronyx, Melospiza and Xenospiza) is considered too heterogeneous and unnecessarily disruptive to generic stability among New World sparrows."	
31349	840	"Taxon occipitalis is treated as a species separate from Melozone leucotis based on differences in plumage and vocalizations (Sandoval et al. 2017a), and a consistent pattern of divergence in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (Sandoval et al. 2017b). Additional investigation of the geographically and phenotypically intermediate subspecies nigrior would provide further insights. After AviList voted on this issue, NACC (issue 2023-C-12) opted not to split occpipitalis, and the issue will likely be reevaluated in a future version of AviList."	
31364	838	"Taxon socorroensis is treated as a subspecies of Pipilo maculatus based on minor plumage differences and smaller size. However, a thorough analysis of geographic variation in size, plumage, vocalizations, and genetics, across all mainland and island populations of the P. maculatus complex is needed to place these differences into context (Bartos Smith & Greenlaw 2020)."	
31398	1123	"Taxa tibialis and luteoviridis are placed in Atlapetes rather than Pselliophorus based on genetic evidence. Mitochondrial DNA data (Klicka et al. 2014; Sánchez-González et al. 2015) indicate that these two species, despite their striking yellow thighs, are embedded within Atlapetes."	
31412	1122	"Taxon meridae is treated as a subspecies of Atlapetes albofrenatus based on available evidence. Plumage traits are variable within each taxon, vocal differences seem minor, and genetic data are lacking; further research needed."	
31435	1121	"Taxon crassus is treated as a species separate from Atlapetes tricolor based on plumage and vocalizations (Sánchez-González et al. 2015), supported by elevational niche differences and mitochondrial DNA data from separate studies (Klicka et al. 2014; Sánchez-González et al. 2015). Although deeply diverged, crassus is represented by a short DNA sequence."	
31437	1114	"Taxon taczanowskii is treated as a monotypic species separate from Atlapetes schistaceus based on genetics, plumage, and vocalizations. Although modest, mitochondrial DNA divergence (Sánchez-González et al. 2015) is greater than some other species pairs in this complex, and support for their monophyly is weak; further research would be informative."	
31447	1120	"Taxon nigrifrons is treated as a monotypic species separate from Atlapetes latinuchus based on plumage and vocalizations (Donegan & Huertas 2006; Donegan et al. 2014), supported by unpublished mitochondrial DNA data. Plumage, vocalizations, and mtDNA all suggest that nigrifrons is more closely related to A. albofrenatus than A. latinuchus, so is treated here as a distinct species. However, reports of individuals with intermediate plumage traits require investigation and published genetic data are needed to confirm this split."	
31457	1113	"Taxon paynteri is treated as a subspecies of Atlapetes leucopterus based on available evidence. Although paynteri differs in tail length, plumage is mostly variable within taxa, vocal differences are modest and based on small sample sizes, and a comprehensive genetic analysis is lacking; further research needed."	
31522	1176	"Monospecific Icteria is placed in Icteridae rather than Icteriidae based on genome-wide DNA data (Oliveros et al. 2019). Despite its distinctive morphology, the genetic divergence between Icteria and other members of the Icteridae is relatively shallow."	
31534	593	Taxon lilianae (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Sturnella magna (polytypic) based on genetics and quantitative vocal differences (Beam et al. 2021). Genomic data did not recover the S. magna-lilianae complex as monophyletic but placed S. magna as sister to S. neglecta with strong support.	
31572	585	"Taxon oleagineus (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Psarocolius angustifrons pending further research. Phenotypic and vocal (e.g., Price & Lanyon 2002a, 2002b, 2004) variation within P. angustifrons is complex and multiple species may be present; however, an integrative study of variation in voice, plumage, and genetics is needed before any changes are made."	
31593	586	"Taxon yuracares (polytypic, including neivae) is treated as conspecific with Psarocolius bifasciatus based on plumage. Subspecies neivae is intermediate in plumage between yuracares and bifasciatus and may represent a hybrid swarm between the two (Haffer 1974); further research needed."	
31602	588	"Monotypic taxa pacificus and microrhynchus are treated as conspecific with Cacicus uropygialis pending further research. Sometimes treated as two or three species based on plumage, vocalizations, macro-ecology, or genetics; however, the available data are contradictory regarding relationships. Overall, the three taxa are similar in plumage but mitochondrial DNA data (Powell et al. 2014) recovered uropygialis and pacificus as sister taxa, and deeply diverged from microrhynchus, whereas macro-ecological data align lowland microrhynchus with pacificus (e.g., Ridgely & Greenfield 2001). Formal analyses of vocalizations and assessment of gene flow among taxa are needed."	
31606	587	"Taxon flavicrissus (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Cacicus cela pending further research. Differences in plumage are maintained range-wide including in a zone of near-parapatry, and limited mitochondrial DNA data indicate a deep divergence (Powell et al. 2014) but vocal data are equivocal regarding species status; the vocal repertoire is large and colony-specific (Feekes 1981), confounding identification of homologous vocalizations (Boesman 2016ggg). Broader genetic sampling based on nuclear or genomic DNA, and an in-depth analysis of vocalizations would be informative."	
31610	589	"Taxon leucoramphus (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Cacicus chrysonotus based on phenotypic evidence of intermediacy (Hosner et al. 2015) and lack of supporting data on vocal differentiation. However, Powell et al. (2014) found relatively deep mitochondrial DNA divergence between representative samples. A formal analysis of vocal differences, including assessment of homologous vocalizations and analysis of intraspecific variation, and assessment of gene flow across contact zones is needed."	
31635	591	"Taxon fuertesi (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Icterus spurius based on plumage, vocalizations, and genetics. Although divergence in calls (Sturge et al. 2016a) and plumage (Hofmann et al. 2007; Kiere et al. 2007) is notable, song differences are minor (Hagemeyer et al. 2012; Sturge et al. 2016a) and mitochondrial DNA divergence is low (Sturge et al. 2016b), a pattern more consistent with subspecies-level differentiation. Further research on ecological differentiation and genomic sampling of rapidly evolving loci would be of interest."	
31655	590	"Taxon chrysocephalus (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Icterus cayanensis based on available evidence. Although plumage differentiation is notable, mitochondrial DNA divergence is low (Omland et al. 1999; d'Horta et al. 2008; Powell et al. 2014), and there is evidence of intermediate phenotypes within a narrow hybrid zone (d'Horta et al. 2008); further research, including assessment of gene flow and divergence using nuclear DNA, is needed."	
31680	N-46	"Swainson’s (1827) original spelling was bullockii in the singular, but he made it clear that it referred to two Bullocks (father and son). There is currently great heterogeneity in the way various zoological disciplines deal with such issues. While the original spelling remains preserved in many animal groups, the prevalent ornithological practice is to change endings to reflect the correct grammatical circumstances, as is done herein by adopting ""bullockiorum"". The upcoming fifth edition of the ICZN Code will introduce standardization into this heterogeneity, which may or may not be in agreement with the position taken herein."	
31752	592	"Taxon armenti (monotypic) is treated as a species separate from Molothrus aeneus (polytypic) based on plumage, morphometric, and vocal differences, and the fact that the merger of these two taxa, formerly considered separate species, was poorly justified (see Dugand & Eisenmann 1983). Genetic data and a formal analysis of differences in display song (Fraga 2011) would be informative."	
31930	529	"The Geothlypis aequinoctialis complex is split into three species based on deep mitochondrial DNA divergences (Escalante et al. 2009), supported by plumage differences: G. aequinoctialis (monotypic); G. auricularis (polytypic, including peruviana); and G. velata (monotypic). A more comprehensive assessment of genetic divergences (including nuclear DNA) and vocalizations is desirable."	
31942	528	"Geothlypis semiflava (polytypic) is retained as a single species. Mitochondrial DNA divergences among the three taxa are modest (Escalante et al. 2009), and vocal responses between bairdi and chiriquensis suggest conspecificity (Freeman & Montgomery 2017). More comprehensive reviews of genetic and vocal variation would be required to justify splits in this species."	
31983	527	"Taxon graysoni is retained within Setophaga pitiayumi, as the evidentiary basis for a split based on vocal differences (Jehl & Parkes 1982) is weak and plumage differences are neotenous. Although Evans et al. (2015) identified graysoni as separable from nominate pitiayumi based largely on analysis of short mitochondrial DNA segments, its position as paraphyletic (Lovette & Bermingham 2001) with respect to the two parulas (Setophaga pitiayumi and S. americana) remains uncertain. Recognizing graysoni as a species is premature without more comprehensive data on genetic and vocal variation among these warblers."	
31998	530	"The temperate-breeding aestiva group (polytypic) is split from Setophaga petechia (polytypic) based on consistent mitochondrial DNA evidence (Klein & Brown 1994; Lovette & Bermingham 1999; Boulet & Gibbs 2006; Chaves et al. 2012), supported by differences in plumage, vocalizations, and ecology. However, geographic variation within the aestiva-petechia complex is extensive and detailed studies of genetics and vocalizations across the entire range of both species would be informative."	
32047	531	"Setophaga coronata is retained as a single species. Genome-wide surveys indicate the presence of three distinct groups within this complex (coronata, auduboni including nigrifrons, and goldmani) (Toews et al. 2016) but a decision to split is deferred pending further research into the auduboni/coronata contact zone."	
32087	535	"In the absence of genetic data to affirm relationships, taxon griseiceps was tentatively placed in the genus Myiothlypis following Lovette et al. (2010); this placement was supported by Zhao et al. (2025) based on mitogenomic data.

32089	534	"Myiothlypis luteoviridis is retained as a single species. Geographic patterns in plumage and vocalizations suggest the presence of three groups (Boesman 2016z; del Hoyo & Collar 2016), but detailed genetic and bioacoustic studies are needed before making any splits."	
32113	536	"Taxon mesoleuca is retained within Myiothlypis rivularis, as the evidentiary basis for a split based on plumage and vocalizations (Boesman 2016n) is weak. A comprehensive analysis of genetics, plumages, and vocalizations is required."	
32117	532	Taxon roraimae is retained within Myiothlypis bivittata. These taxa are highly divergent based on analysis of mitochondrial DNA (Lovette et al. 2010) and have very different songs (Boesman 2016o) but a split is deferred pending publication of current research.	
32121	533	Taxon chlorophrys is split from Myiothlypis chrysogaster based on obvious differences in vocalizations (Boesman 2016p).	
32142	537	"Taxon delattrii (polytypic, including mesochrysus and actuosus) is split from Basileuterus rufifrons based on differences in plumage, morphometrics, and vocalizations, including an extensive study of these traits in areas of sympatry (Demko et al. 2019, 2020)."	
32163	538	"Basileuterus culicivorus is retained as a single species, as available morphological, vocal (Boesman 2016q), and genetic data (Vilaça & Santos 2010) reveal complex patterns of differentiation. A more comprehensive assessment based on genomics and vocalizations is required."	
32178	539	"Basileuterus tristriatus (polytypic) is split into four species based on differences in vocalizations and plumages (Donegan 2014): B. melanotis (monotypic); B. tacarcunae (monotypic); B. punctipectus (polytypic, including inconspicuus and canens); and nominate B. tristriatus. This arrangement is supported by the mitochondrial DNA study of Gutiérrez-Pinto et al. (2012), with B. tristriatus sensu lato recovered as paraphyletic."	
32235	540	Taxon chrysops is retained within Myioborus ornatus pending further research on genetics and vocalizations. Mitochondrial DNA divergences within the M. ornatus-M. melanocephalus complex are shallow (Pérez-Emán 2005; Céspedes-Arias 2021) and extensive hybridization occurs where the two species come into contact (Céspedes-Arias 2021). In the absence of relevant genomic data a conservative approach has been adopted.	
32266	578	"Taxon francescae is treated as a subspecies of Granatellus venustus, as the evidentiary basis for a split is weak. Plumage differences are minor and the lack of a black breast band is not diagnostic (Grant 1965; Gómez de Silva et al. 2020). Data on vocal and genetic differentiation would be informative."	
32272	579	"Taxon paraensis is treated as a species separate from Granatellus pelzelni based primarily on divergence in mitochondrial (Dornas et al. 2022) and genomic DNA data (Scott 2022), supported by minor plumage differences. Although vocalizations appear strikingly different (Boesman 2016r), it is unclear if homologous songs have been compared (i.e., female song of paraensis may have been compared to male song of pelzelni); further research needed. After the AviList vote, SACC considered this split and decided against it; this issue thus may warrant reconsideration for a future version of AviList."	
32289	594	"New generic limits for the Thraupidae (based on Burns et al. 2014, 2016) are adopted except that rustica is placed in Haplospiza rather than Spodiornis. Although this renders Haplospiza as non-monophyletic based on mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Burns et al. 2014, 2016), similarities in plumage, their bamboo-specialist ecology, and song types align H. rustica with H. unicolor; broader genomic and taxon sampling is needed to better define generic limits within this group, which also includes Acanthidops and Geospizopsis."	
32290	584	"Taxon aequatorialis is treated as a monotypic species separate from Amaurospiza concolor based on genetic evidence of paraphyly (Scott 2022; Areta et al. 2023), supported by minor plumage differences. Taxon relicta, sometimes treated as specifically distinct, shows low mitochondrial DNA divergence (Areta et al. 2023) and is maintained as a subspecies of A. concolor pending further research on vocal and genetic variation in this complex."	
32325	1195a	"The genus Driophlox is recognized for four species of Habia tanagers following Scott et al. (2024): D. gutturalis; D. atrimaxillaris; D. cristata; and D. fuscicauda. Genomic DNA analyses (Scott et al. 2022) recovered Habia as polyphyletic, with H. rubica sister to Chlorothraupis, rather than to the species now placed in Driophlox."	
32344	1195b	Chlorothraupis is retained as a separate genus from Habia based on morphology and depth of divergence in mitochondrial-dominated and genomic DNA data (Barker et al. 2015; Scott et al. 2022).	
32345	581	"Taxon frenata is treated as a species separate from Chlorothraupis carmioli based on genetics, supported by vocal and plumage differences. Genomic data (Scott 2022) indicate that C. carmioli is paraphyletic, with frenata recovered as sister to C. olivacea. Although formal bioacoustic analyses are lacking, vocalizations of frenata differ consistently from carmioli and are readily distinguished (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001; Hilty 2022), and differences in plumage, although minor, are commensurate with those between other species of Chlorothraupis."	
32354	582	"Two species are recognized within Caryothraustes (poliogaster and canadensis), with celaeno and erythromelas placed in Periporphyrus based on the deep genetic divergences within an expanded Caryothraustes (Klicka et al. 2014; Barker et al. 2015). Although celaeno is sometimes placed in the monospecific genus Rhodothraupis, similarities in plumage, vocalizations, behavior, and habitat suggest that it is better placed in Periporphyrus."	
32420	583	"Taxa hepatica (polytypic) and lutea (polytypic) are treated as conspecific with Piranga flava pending further research. Extensive geographic variation in plumage, vocalizations (Boesman 2016s), and genetics (Manthey et al. 2016) occurs within P. flava sensu lato that likely represents multiple species. However, integrative bioacoustic, genetic, and morphological analyses, with broader taxon and geographic sampling, are needed to determine species limits within this complex."	
32505	615	"Taxon egregia (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Dacnis lineata based on minor differences in plumage and vocalizations. Although genomic data (Price-Waldman 2019) did not recover D. lineata sensu lato as monophyletic, taxon sampling was limited; additional data are needed to corroborate this result. However, after the AviList vote on this issue, it was considered and passed by SACC, and will be reconsidered for a future version of AviList."	
32596	434	Heliothraupis oneilli is recognized as a new species and genus following Lane et al. (2021). Both genomic and multilocus DNA data show that H. oneilli forms a clade with Trichothraupis and Eucometis; future generic revisions of this complex may be warranted.	
32657	619	"Taxon icteronotus (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Ramphocelus flammigerus based on low divergence and lack of geographic structure in mitochondrial DNA, and concordant clines in plumage across a hybrid zone (Morales-Rozo et al. 2017)."	
32660	618	"Taxon costaricensis (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Ramphocelus passerinii based on minor differences in plumage and vocalizations, similar response to playback (Freeman & Montgomery 2017), and relatively low mitochondrial DNA divergence (Hackett 1996)."	
32663	N-41	Ramphocelus bresilius has also been used. Usage of bresilia follows Schodde & Bock (2016).	
32715	621	Taxon fraseri (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Conirostrum cinereum based on variability in plumage traits and possible clinality within both forms.	
32751	N-47	"Sicalis uropigyalis is the original spelling, and has also been used. As the word uropygium, spelled correctly, is used over 30 times in the original publication, while uropigyalis is only used twice, we hold that this is clear evidence of an inadvertent error, contra David and Dickinson (2014). S. uropygialis is also in prevailing usage by an order of magnitude according to Google Scholar."	
32791	620	"Taxon petersi (polytypic) is treated as a species separate from Xenodacnis parina (monotypic) based on differences in plumage, size, and vocalizations, with the disjunct population at Arequipa placed in X. petersi. More detailed analyses of genetics, morphology, and vocalizations would be informative. After this issue was considered by AviList, SACC considered and rejected this proposal, which will likely be reconsidered for a future version of AviList."	
32808	925	"Taxon bairdi is placed in the monotypic genus Acanthidops pending further research. Mitochondrial-dominated DNA data (Burns et al. 2014) suggest that A. bairdi is embedded in Haplospiza and this clade is sister to Geospizopsis. While merging Acanthidops into Haplospiza is plausible, support for the position of H. unicolor is low, and individual gene trees produced conflicting results. Furthermore, Barker et al. (2015), using the same data, recovered a different topology for these five species. Additional data is needed to better resolve this phylogeny."	
33028	595	"Sporophila iberaensis is recognized as a species based on plumage, vocalizations, behavior, and genetics. S. iberaensis occurs sympatrically and mates assortatively with respect to S. hypoxantha (Turbek et al. 2021), and the two species show clear differentiation based on genomic DNA, although mitochondrial DNA divergence is lacking (Turbek et al. 2021). There is uncertainty surrounding the use of the species name iberaensis; nomenclatural clarification required."	
33050	617	"Taxon ophthalmica (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Sporophila corvina based largely on genetic evidence. Neither mitochondrial DNA nor genomic data recovered the ophthalmica group as monophyletic (Ocampo et al. 2022), and there is evidence of gene flow and a hybrid swarm between corvina and subspecies hicksii (Olson 1981; Stiles 1996; Ocampo et al. 2022)."	
33059	616	Taxon murallae (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Sporophila americana based on the lack of diagnostic plumage and morphometric characters (Lane & Stiles 2022). Further research needed to determine if murallae should be synonymized.	
33116	614	"Taxon chrysogaster (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Cnemoscopus rubrirostris based on a lack of vocal differences (Schulenberg et al. 2010) and the occurrence of birds of intermediate phenotype in contact areas; further research needed. However, after the AviList vote on this issue, it was considered and passed by SACC, and will be reconsidered for a future version of AviList."	
33123	N-48	"Poospizopsis hypochondria has also been used. The original spelling (named in Emberiza) is ""E. hypocondria, Nob."". Subsequent publications including Paynter & Storer (1970) (p. 118 of Peters vol. 13) changed this to hypochondria on the basis of it being a ""typographical error"", but it had not been corrected anywhere in the original publication. The original spelling hypocondria should stand, because incorrect latinizations do not count as inadvertent errors (Article 32.5.1). There is contention over whether the spelling hypochondria enjoys prevailing usage. It has been used more widely than hypocondria, but it remains unclear whether the magnitude of this excess of usage should count as ‘prevailing’. At the time of this assessment, Google searches showed that hypochondria was used less than 3 times as much as hypocondria, which is not generally thought of as ‘prevailing usage’. Only when constricting search results to published works by using Google Scholar, the excess usage of hypochondria rose to more than an order of magnitude. However, the Glossary of the Code explicitly allows ""works"" to be unpublished texts or illustrations, suggesting that conventional Google searches can be used as indicative of general usage."	
33143	612	"Taxon pectoralis (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Microspingus torquatus pending further research. Although differences in vocalizations (Boesman 2016t) and mitochondrial DNA (Lougheed et al. 2000; Burns et al. 2014) occur, a more comprehensive assessment of morphology, vocalizations, and genetics is needed."	
33150	613	"Taxon auricularis is treated as a subspecies of Kleinothraupis atropileus based on similarities in vocalizations (Boesman 2016aa) and plumage. Mitochondrial DNA data show a fairly deep divergence (García-Moreno et al. 2001; García-Moreno & Fjeldså 2003), but relationships are poorly resolved and inconsistent with genomic data (Price-Waldman 2019). Further research needed."	
33163	611	"Taxa piurae (polytypic) and ochracea (monotypic) are treated as species separate from Sphenopsis melanotis based on a combination of plumage (Halley 2022), vocalizations (Boesman 2016bb), and genetics, with genomic data (Price-Waldman 2019) recovering S. melanotis sensu lato as paraphyletic with respect to S. frontalis. Given the complex patterns of plumage variation in this group, further research on species limits is warranted."	
33257	622	"Taxon taylori (monotypic) is treated as a species separate from Melopyrrha nigra based on differences in plumage, size, and proportions, and possible vocal differences (Garrido et al. 2014). Formal bioacoustic analysis and genetic data would be informative."	
33328	623	"Taxon darwini (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Geospiza magnirostris based on bill morphology (Grant 1986) and distributional rationale, with darwini more likely a subspecies of the widespread magnirostris rather than the narrowly endemic propinqua."	
33363	609	"Taxon darwinii (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Rauenia bonariensis (polytypic) based on available evidence. Although the male plumage of darwinii is distinctive, there is geographic variation within the bonariensis group and vocalizations are complex (Boesman 2016u). Thorough analyses of geographic variation in plumage and vocalizations, as well as genetic data, are needed."	
33371	608	"The monotypic taxa carrikeri and stictocephala are treated as species separate from Dubusia taeniata based on plumage and vocalizations. Although vocal differences have been identified (Boesman 2016v), no formal analyses have been undertaken and vocalizations of taeniata are quite variable, suggesting further research is warranted. Genetic data would also be informative."	
33421	607	"Taxon lunulatus (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Anisognathus igniventris based on available evidence. Plumage differences seem minor, apparent vocal differences have not been thoroughly documented (Boesman 2016w), and mitochondrial DNA divergence (Sedano & Burns 2010; Freeman et al. 2023) is comparable to that found between other subspecies in this complex; however, more thorough geographic and genetic sampling could be informative."	
33426	606	"Taxon flavinucha (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Anisognathus somptuosus (polytypic) pending further research. Although flavinucha is phenotypically distinct, and vocal differences have been identified (Boesman 2016x), a thorough examination of geographic patterns of variation within the remainder of the A. somptuosus complex is needed. Likewise, mitochondrial DNA differences are apparent (Sedano & Burns 2010) but geographic sampling is limited."	
33439	610	"Taxon fulgentissima (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Chlorochrysa calliparaea (polytypic) based on available evidence. Although the plumage of fulgentissima differs noticeably from subspecies bourcieri, the plumage of nominate calliparaea is intermediate between these two (Hellmayr 1936; Zimmer 1943a). Analyses of genetic and vocal data may shed light on species limits in this group."	
33497	603	"Taxon atrocoerulea (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Tangara vassorii (polytypic) based on the intermediacy of plumage in subspecies branickii and possible clinality. Supporting information from range-wide studies of plumage, vocalizations, and genetics is needed."	
33518	597	"Taxon brasiliensis (monotypic) is treated as a species separate from Tangara mexicana based on differences in plumage (Mallet-Rodrigues & Gonzaga 2015), and divergence in mitochondrial DNA (Burns & Naoki 2004). However, the geographic distribution of phenotypic variation is complex (Mallet-Rodrigues & Gonzaga 2015), formal analyses of vocalizations are lacking, and broader genetic sampling is desirable."	
33529	604	"Taxon cyanomelas (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Tangara velia (polytypic) based on plumage differences being mostly degrees of shading, and lack of supporting information from genetics and vocalizations. Further research needed."	
33563	601	"Taxon lunigera (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Tangara parzudakii (polytypic) based on available evidence. Although plumage differences are obvious, they appear to reflect degrees of saturation, and vary to some extent within taxa. Supporting information from vocalizations and genetics is needed."	
33571	602	"Taxon aurulenta (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Tangara arthus pending further research. Plumage variation within this complex is extensive and it may comprise multiple species. An integrative analysis of plumage, vocalizations, and genetics is needed to better define species limits in this group."	
33587	605	"Taxon fulvicervix (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Chalcothraupis ruficervix based on available evidence. Although plumage differences between these taxa are pronounced, subspecies amabilis from the fulvicervix group shows evidence of intermediacy (Zimmer 1943b), such that differing arrangements of subspecies allocation have been proposed (e.g., Isler & Isler 1987). Genetic and vocal data would provide an additional perspective on the status of these proposed species."	
33646	1163	"Taxon whitelyi is treated as a species separate from Stilpnia argentea based on available evidence. These taxa show significant differences in male and female plumage (Isler & Isler 1987) and, while genetic data are lacking, there are vocal differences that seem surprisingly pronounced for presumed sister species (Remsen 2024)."	
33659	599	"Taxon flava (polytypic) is treated as conspecific with Stilpnia cayana based on available evidence. Although obvious plumage differences exist, geographic variation is poorly understood and intermediate phenotypes occur in areas of contact (Isler & Isler 1987). Moreover, mitochondrial DNA divergence is shallow and show discordant subspecies groupings compared to rapidly evolving nuclear DNA loci (Savit & Bates 2015)."	
33667	600	"Taxon versicolor (monotypic) is treated as a subspecies of Stilpnia cucullata based on available evidence. Plumage characters consist of differences in shading rather than pattern, bill size differences are based on small sample sizes, and mitochondrial DNA divergence is low (Ricklefs & Bermingham 2001; Sedano & Burns 2010)."
